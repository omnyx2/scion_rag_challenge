    "abstract": "한국에서 교통사고를 줄이는 목적으로 디지털운행기록계(DTG) 장치가 모든 상용차량에 의무 장착이 되어 GPS 궤적을 포함한 많은 양의 운행기록 데이터가 생성되고 있다. 지금까지 이러한 DTG 데이터는 주로 교통안전운전을 유도하는 용도로 사용되어왔다. 그러나 DTG데이터는 연료소모량을 줄일 수 있는 에코드라이빙 분야 등 다양한 분야로 활용도를 확대할 수 있다. 본 연구는 실제 운행한 대규모 DTG운행 데이터를 공간 빅데이터 분석을 통해 연료소모량을 추정할 수 있는 모델을 수립하는 연구이다. 기존의 연료소모량 추정 모델은 주로 실험실 환경 또는 일부 지역에 국한되어 검증한 모델로 실제 운행되는 상용차량 대상으로 분석할 경우 수집하기 어려운 변수들이 많고, 한국의 전국을 운행한 다양한 운행기록 데이터를 적용하면 정확도가 낮아지는 문제점이 있다. 본 연구에서는 이러한 문제를 개선하기 위해 DTG데이터와 공간 빅데이터를 이용한 연료소모량 추정 모델인 SBiFEM(Spatial Big Data Fuel Estimation Model)을 제안하였다. SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다.  SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다.",

    "abstract": "<P>The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment. The presentation will conclude with a set of requirements and a summary of recommendations for future priorities.</P>",

Building on literature in environmental studies, cultural studies and Science and Technology Studies, the article draws attention to the physical presence of data, the material configuration of digital service, and the space occupied by data. It then explains how this material and situated character of data raises questions concerning the ethics of the increasingly fashionable Big Data discourses. It argues that attention should be paid to (1) the vocabulary currently used when discussing the governance of data initiatives; (2) the internal tension between current data initiatives and environmental policies; (3) issues of fair distribution. The article explains how taking into account these aspects would allow for a more responsible behaviour in the context of data storage and production.</P>",

But in practice no model is ever entirely phenomenological or entirely mechanistic. We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient. These domain-specific requirements suggest a need for targeted funding, in which big data technologies for in silico medicine becomes the research priority.</P>",

    "title": "Compromise between Small Data and Big Data",
    "abstract": "Purpose: The main purpose of this work was to present the problems of big data and to present how small data can be used as a complement to big data and its effects step by step in the big data through the concept of value chain. Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data.",

Big Data describes large amounts of data. High precision of big data can contribute to decision-making confidence, and better estimates can help increase efficiency, reduce costs, and risks. Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately. We described the K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering -DBSCAN algorithm, and the STING algorithm for network-based clustering.</P>",

    "abstract": "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Nowadays, valuable big data are generated and collected rapidly from numerous rich data sources. Following the initiatives of open data, many organizations including municipal governments are willing to share their data such as open big data regarding parking violations. While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected. Hence, in this article, we present a model for supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data. This temporally hierarchical privacy-preserving model (THPPM) adapts and extends the traditional temporal hierarchy to generalize spatial data generated within a time interval with an aim to preserve privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations during some time intervals at certain geographic locations. Evaluation on open big data from two North American cities demonstrates the usefulness of our model in supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data.</P>",

    "title": "Protecting Privacy in Big Data",
    "abstract": "In an age of big data, privacy is more essential than ever before, but if we are to protect it effectively, while continuing to enjoy the benefits that big data is already making possible, we need to evolve better, faster, and more scalable mechanisms.The following are the four core elements critical to effective governance of big data.First, a transformation of the current approach to a risk management approach that places more responsibility for data stewardship, and liability for reasonably foreseeable harms, on the users of data rather than using notice and consent to shift the burden to individuals seems critical. This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data.",

    "abstract": "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>Future buildings will more and more rely on advanced Building Management Systems (BMS) connected to a variety of sensors, actuators and dedicated networks. Their objectives are to observe the state of rooms and apply automated rules to preserve or increase comfort while economizing energy. In this work, we advocate for the inclusion of a dedicated system for sensors data storage and processing, based on Big Data technologies. This choice enables new potentials in terms of data analytics and applications development, the most obvious one being the ability to scale up seamlessly from one smart building to several, in the direction of smart areas and smart cities. We report in this paper on our system architecture and on several challenges we met in its elaboration, attempting to meet requirements of scalability, data processing, flexibility, interoperability and privacy. We also describe current and future end-user services that our platform will support, including historical data retrieval, visualisation, processing and alarms. The platform, called BBData - <I>Big Building Data</I>, is currently in production at the Smart Living Lab of Fribourg and is offered to several research teams to ease their work, to foster the sharing of historical data and to avoid that each project develops its own data gathering and processing pipeline.</P>",

Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data.

    "abstract": "In general statistical analysis, we need to make a normal assumption. If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data.",

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though.

Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches.

This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.</P><P>De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

    "abstract": "The big data term refers to the great volume of data and complicated data structure with difficulties in collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing these data. Big data analytics refers to the operation of disclosing hidden patterns through big data. This information and data set cloud to be useful and provide advanced services. However, analyzing and processing this information could cause revealing and disclosing some sensitive and personal information when the information is contained in applications that are correlated to users such as location-based services, but concerns are diminished if the applications are correlated to general information such as scientific results. In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data.",

    "abstract": "<P><B>Abstract</B></P><P>The rapid development of synchrotrons has massively increased the speed at which experiments can be performed, while new techniques have increased the amount of raw data collected during each experiment. While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage. These effects, collectively known as the &ldquo;data deluge,&rdquo; affect synchrotrons in several different ways including fast data collection, available local storage, data management systems, and curation of the data. This review highlights the Big Data strategies adopted nowadays at synchrotrons, documenting this novel and promising hybridization between science and technology, which promise a dramatic increase in the number of scientific discoveries.</P>",

    "abstract": "<P>The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0. This is an important first step and will have a significant influence on implementing the concept of big data inside the statistical offices of Germany.</P>",

    "title": "Exploring Big Data Governance Frameworks",
    "abstract": "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework.</P>",

    "title": "Big genetic data and its big data protection challenges",
    "abstract": "<P><B>Abstract</B></P>  <P>The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question.</P>",

Thus, analysis has continued for a long time in the quantity and quality of data, and there are changes in the location of data in the social sciences, past trends and the emergence of big data. The introduction of big data is presented as a prototype of new social science and is a useful practical example that empirically shows the need, basis, and direction of analysis through trend prediction services. Big data provides a future perspective as an important foundation for social change within the framework of basic social sciences.",
