Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling."

          "text": "Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given."

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."

          "text": "Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence AI has been well supported by government research and development dollars for decades now, and people are beginning to ask hard questions: What really works? What are the limits? What doesn't work as advertised? What isn't likely to work? What isn't affordable? This article holds a mirror up to the community, both to provide feedback and stimulate more self-assessment. The significant accomplishments and strengths of the field are highlighted. The research agenda, strategy, and heuristics are reviewed, and a change of course is recommended to improve the field's ability to produce reusable and interoperable components.(Author abstract)"

It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation. This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition."
