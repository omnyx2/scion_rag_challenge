In the field of MR imaging research, deep learning methods are also rapidly being applied in a wide range of areas to complement or replace traditional model-based methods. Deep learning methods have shown remarkable improvements in several MR image processing areas such as image reconstruction, image quality improvement, parameter mapping, image contrast conversion, and image segmentation. With the current rapid development of deep learning technologies, the importance of the role of deep learning in MR imaging research appears to be growing.

          "text": "Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."

Over the past decade, AI has proven its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Various aspects of clinical practice in neuroimaging can be improved with the help of AI. For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images. In addition, image quality can be improved via AI-based image reconstruction or motion artifact reduction. In this review, we summarize recent clinical applications of DL in various aspects of neuroimaging."

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for the enhancement of a series of steps in the radiomics pipeline, from image acquisition and preprocessing, to segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model development. The aim of this review is to present the most used AI methods for radiomics analysis, explaining the advantages and limitations of the methods. Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption. Importantly, this review will aim to highlight how AI can assist radiomics in overcoming major bottlenecks in clinical implementation, ultimately improving the translation potential of the method."
