It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다. IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다.

          "text": "Exploring Artificial Intelligence Futures Exploring Artificial Intelligence Futures Exploring Artificial Intelligence Futures Artificial intelligence technologies are receiving high levels of attention and ‘hype’, leading to a range of speculation about futures in which such technologies, and their successors, are commonly deployed. By looking at existing AI futures work, this paper surveys, and offers an initial categorisation of, several of the tools available for such futures-exploration, in particular those available to humanities scholars, and discusses some of the benefits and limitations of each. While no tools exist to reliably predict the future of artificial intelligence, several tools can help us expand our range of possible futures in order to reduce unexpected surprises, and to create common languages and models that enable constructive conversations about the kinds of futures we would like to occupy or avoid. The paper points at several tools as particularly promising and currently neglected, calling for more work in data-driven, realistic, integrative, and participatory scenario role-plays."

While corporate and government officials organize new projects whose potential impact is widespread, to date few people have been more affected by the transition than those already in the field. The author reviews some aspects of this transition, and poses some issues for AI researchers, developers, and leaders."

Starting with a brief history of artificial intelligence, this article presents a general overview of this broad interdisciplinary field, organized around the main modules of the notional architecture of an intelligent agent (knowledge representation; problem solving and planning; knowledge acquisition and learning; natural language, speech, and vision; action processing and robotics) which highlights both the main areas of artificial intelligence research, development and application, and also their integration.

          "text": "Artificial Agential Intelligence Artificial Agential Intelligence Artificial Agential Intelligence Since artificial intelligence (AI) emerged in the mid-20th century, it has incurred many theoretical criticisms (Dreyfus, H. [1972] What Computers Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Dreyfus, H. [1992] What Computers Still Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Searle, J. [1980] Minds, brains and programs, Behav. Brain Sci.3, 417-457; Searle, J. [1984] Minds, Brains and Sciences (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA); Searle, J. [1992] The Rediscovery of the Mind (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA); Fodor, J. [2002] The Mind Doesn&rsquo;t Work that Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).). The technical improvements of machine learning and deep learning, though, have been continuing and many breakthroughs have occurred recently. This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J. [1996] Mind and World (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), imaginative understanding (Campbell, J. [2020] Causation in Psychology (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), and animal knowledge (Sosa, E. [2007] A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge, volume 1 (Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK); Sosa, E. [2015] Judgment and Agency (Oxford University Press, Cambridge, MA)). Moreover, I will explore whether and in what way neuroscience-inspired AI and predictive coding (Hassabis, D., Kumaran, D., Summerfield, C., &amp; Botvinick, M. [2017] Neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence, Neuron95(2), 245-258) can help carry out this project."

The story is embedded into three main steps of history. In view of a sustainable future of our globe it is deemed necessary to vigorously advance the initiated third step. Assuming AI's due role in this process would mean a change in its long-term goal: enhancing rather than simulating human intelligence."
