Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined."

          "text": "Deep Contour Recovery: Repairing Breaks in Detected Contours using Deep Learning Deep Contour Recovery: Repairing Breaks in Detected Contours using Deep Learning Deep Contour Recovery: Repairing Breaks in Detected Contours using Deep Learning We present a contour recovery framework based on a deep learning model to connect broken contours (breaks) produced by contour detection methods. The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods."
