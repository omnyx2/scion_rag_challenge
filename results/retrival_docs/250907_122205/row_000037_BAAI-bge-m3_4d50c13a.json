This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area. NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."
