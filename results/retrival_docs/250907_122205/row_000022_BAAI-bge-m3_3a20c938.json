Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem."

          "text": "A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis The image analysis is an important and predominant task for classifying the different parts of the image. The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information."

In particular, with the development of AR, VR, and MR technologies related to image processing, the utilization of computer vision based on deep learning has increased. The algorithms for object recognition and detection based on deep learning required for image processing are diversified and advanced. Accordingly, problems that were difficult to solve with the existing methodology were solved more simply and easily by using deep learning. This paper introduces various deep learning-based object recognition and extraction algorithms used to detect and recognize various objects in an image and analyzes the technologies that attract attention."

          "text": "Deep learning for radar Deep learning for radar Deep learning for radar Motivated by the recent advances in deep learning, we lay out a vision of how deep learning techniques can be used in radar. Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem."
