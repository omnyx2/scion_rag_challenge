          "text": "Protecting Privacy in Big Data Protecting Privacy in Big Data Protecting Privacy in Big Data In an age of big data, privacy is more essential than ever before, but if we are to protect it effectively, while continuing to enjoy the benefits that big data is already making possible, we need to evolve better, faster, and more scalable mechanisms.The following are the four core elements critical to effective governance of big data.First, a transformation of the current approach to a risk management approach that places more responsibility for data stewardship, and liability for reasonably foreseeable harms, on the users of data rather than using notice and consent to shift the burden to individuals seems critical. This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data."

Big data analytics refers to the operation of disclosing hidden patterns through big data. This information and data set cloud to be useful and provide advanced services. However, analyzing and processing this information could cause revealing and disclosing some sensitive and personal information when the information is contained in applications that are correlated to users such as location-based services, but concerns are diminished if the applications are correlated to general information such as scientific results. In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data."

SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie. Outre les mus&eacute;es qui rendent accessibles au public une partie de leurs collections, de nombreuses bases de donn&eacute;es sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es, par exemple sur les terra sigillata ou les pi&egrave;ces de monnaie, sont &eacute;galement disponibles en ligne. Dans certains pays, comme la Norv&egrave;ge, une grande partie des d&eacute;couvertes arch&eacute;ologiques sont syst&eacute;matiquement publi&eacute;es dans une base de donn&eacute;es en ligne pour une exploitation ult&eacute;rieure.L&rsquo;&eacute;valuation automatis&eacute;e de grands ensembles de donn&eacute;es non tri&eacute;es, qui est associ&eacute;e &agrave; l&rsquo;expression &#x201e;Big data&ldquo;, a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re judicieuse &agrave; plusieurs reprises, comme le montre le projet NEOMINE ou le projet &#x201e;ancient places&ldquo; d&rsquo;Alphabet Inc. Un rejet global de grandes collections d&rsquo;objets et de donn&eacute;es reste incompr&eacute;hensible au vu des possibilit&eacute;s et surtout des m&eacute;thodes d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;tablies dans les sciences naturelles et devrait &ecirc;tre reconsid&eacute;r&eacute; en faveur d&rsquo;une vision plus objective et, bien s&ucirc;r, non d&eacute;pourvue d&rsquo;esprit critique des nouvelles m&eacute;thodes de recherche."

Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data."

Outre les mus&eacute;es qui rendent accessibles au public une partie de leurs collections, de nombreuses bases de donn&eacute;es sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es, par exemple sur les terra sigillata ou les pi&egrave;ces de monnaie, sont &eacute;galement disponibles en ligne. Dans certains pays, comme la Norv&egrave;ge, une grande partie des d&eacute;couvertes arch&eacute;ologiques sont syst&eacute;matiquement publi&eacute;es dans une base de donn&eacute;es en ligne pour une exploitation ult&eacute;rieure.L&rsquo;&eacute;valuation automatis&eacute;e de grands ensembles de donn&eacute;es non tri&eacute;es, qui est associ&eacute;e &agrave; l&rsquo;expression &#x201e;Big data&ldquo;, a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re judicieuse &agrave; plusieurs reprises, comme le montre le projet NEOMINE ou le projet &#x201e;ancient places&ldquo; d&rsquo;Alphabet Inc. Un rejet global de grandes collections d&rsquo;objets et de donn&eacute;es reste incompr&eacute;hensible au vu des possibilit&eacute;s et surtout des m&eacute;thodes d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;tablies dans les sciences naturelles et devrait &ecirc;tre reconsid&eacute;r&eacute; en faveur d&rsquo;une vision plus objective et, bien s&ucirc;r, non d&eacute;pourvue d&rsquo;esprit critique des nouvelles m&eacute;thodes de recherche."

Big data analytics refers to the operation of disclosing hidden patterns through big data. This information and data set cloud to be useful and provide advanced services. However, analyzing and processing this information could cause revealing and disclosing some sensitive and personal information when the information is contained in applications that are correlated to users such as location-based services, but concerns are diminished if the applications are correlated to general information such as scientific results. In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data."

Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data."

Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient."

AI 사용 여부의 공개에 대해서는 콘텐츠 가치유형에 관계없이 지켜야 할 원칙으로 인식되었으나, 실용적 콘텐츠에 대해 그러한 인식이 더 강하게 드러났다. 본 연구는 AI 활용의 투명성과 진정성을 제고하는 방안이 필요함을 시사하며, 향후 AI의 발전과 활용이 소비자 인식에 미치는 영향을 지속적으로 연구할 필요가 있음을 강조한다."

          "text": "Big genetic data and its big data protection challenges Big genetic data and its big data protection challenges Big genetic data and its big data protection challenges Abstract The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question."
