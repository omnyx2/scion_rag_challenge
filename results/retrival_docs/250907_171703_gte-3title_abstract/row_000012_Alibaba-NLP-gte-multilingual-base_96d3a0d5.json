For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images. In addition, image quality can be improved via AI-based image reconstruction or motion artifact reduction. In this review, we summarize recent clinical applications of DL in various aspects of neuroimaging."

Various efforts have been made to develop computer-assisted systems to improve the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and acute stroke triage. The widespread emergence of artificial intelligence technology has been integrated into the field of medicine. Artificial intelligence can play an important role in providing care to patients with stroke. In the past few decades, numerous studies have explored the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for application in the management of stroke. In this review, we will start with a brief introduction to machine learning and deep learning and provide clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning in various aspects of stroke management, including rapid diagnosis and improved triage, identifying large vessel occlusion, predicting time from stroke onset, automated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) measurement, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcome. This work is focused on providing the current application of artificial intelligence techniques in the imaging of ischemic stroke, including MRI and CT."

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis.

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

In this paper, we provide a framework for developing practical and reasonable data sharing policies that incorporate the sociological, financial, technical and scientific requirements of a sustainable Big Data dependent scientific community.FindingsMany biomedical and healthcare studies may be significantly impacted by using large, heterogeneous and incongruent datasets; however there are significant technical, social, regulatory, and institutional barriers that need to be overcome to ensure the power of Big Data overcomes these detrimental factors.ConclusionsPragmatic policies that demand extensive sharing of data, promotion of data fusion, provenance, interoperability and balance security and protection of personal information are critical for the long term impact of translational Big Data analytics."

Various efforts have been made to develop computer-assisted systems to improve the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and acute stroke triage. The widespread emergence of artificial intelligence technology has been integrated into the field of medicine. Artificial intelligence can play an important role in providing care to patients with stroke. In the past few decades, numerous studies have explored the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for application in the management of stroke. In this review, we will start with a brief introduction to machine learning and deep learning and provide clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning in various aspects of stroke management, including rapid diagnosis and improved triage, identifying large vessel occlusion, predicting time from stroke onset, automated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) measurement, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcome. This work is focused on providing the current application of artificial intelligence techniques in the imaging of ischemic stroke, including MRI and CT."

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information."

Big data analytics refers to the operation of disclosing hidden patterns through big data. This information and data set cloud to be useful and provide advanced services. However, analyzing and processing this information could cause revealing and disclosing some sensitive and personal information when the information is contained in applications that are correlated to users such as location-based services, but concerns are diminished if the applications are correlated to general information such as scientific results. In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data."
