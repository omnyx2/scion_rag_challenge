Especially, 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)' was used to compare the robot arm motion difference between before the maintenance(bearing change) and after the maintenance. 6-axies vibration sensor was used to detect the vibration sensing during the motion of the robot arm. The results of the comparison, MD value of the arm motions of the after the maintenance(bearing change) was much lower and stable compared to MD value of the arm motions of the before the maintenance. MD value well distinguished the fine difference of the arm vibration of the robot. The superior performance of the MT method applied to the prediction of the robot trouble was verified by this experiments."

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years.

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). AI and ML have repeatedly shown how they revolutionise entire industries and sectors. The RecAIcle project focuses on plastic and battery characterisation and sorting. Thus, the productivity and quality of manual sorting are to be increased, and a digital assistance system that supports sorting employees in their sorting decisions is being developed for this purpose. Due to the unique requirements of such a system, the framework design was adapted accordingly. For the development of this system, advanced, life-long learning ML models are needed, which in turn require large amounts of high-quality training data and computing power. In order to provide sufficient use-case-specific training data, experiments were carried out under controlled conditions on a pilot plant scale for training data acquisition. The results of the system design process and the first training data acquisition are presented in this paper. An outlook on future developments and further planned trials is also given."

Especially, 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)' was used to compare the robot arm motion difference between before the maintenance(bearing change) and after the maintenance. 6-axies vibration sensor was used to detect the vibration sensing during the motion of the robot arm. The results of the comparison, MD value of the arm motions of the after the maintenance(bearing change) was much lower and stable compared to MD value of the arm motions of the before the maintenance. MD value well distinguished the fine difference of the arm vibration of the robot. The superior performance of the MT method applied to the prediction of the robot trouble was verified by this experiments."

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model."

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy."

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."
