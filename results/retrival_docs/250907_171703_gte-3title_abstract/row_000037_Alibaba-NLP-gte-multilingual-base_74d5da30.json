This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area.NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다. IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다. IT 컨버전스 및 기술표준화의 이해, n-Screen 콘텐츠와 서비스를 향한 GㆍBㆍC의 역할변화와 정보 활용의 다양화 등등 새로운 시각에서 접근해야 한다.&nbsp;여기서 소개하는 Original XML은 쌍방향ㆍ다방향 소통과 표현을 통해 21세기를 주도할 Community Culture Society를 실현할 것으로 기대된다.

Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area.NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."

From such perspective, this study found examples of the services in the IT convergence industries and the application technologies for the realization of those services; and conducted a research based on the examples, using the technical Characteristics classification; and based on the result, analyzed the standards and the peculiarity of technologies employed for the IT convergence service and the correlation and the complementarity between them; also identified the standards and the peculiarity of technologies required by the IT convergence services and analyzed the correlation between them; and finally analyzed the compatibility between the IT convergence services and the applied technologies. The conclusion of this study is expected to be utilized for selecting technologies for the introduction and the operation of the optimal IT convergence service and as a benchmark as well."

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."
