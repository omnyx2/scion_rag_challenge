Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data."

SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie. Outre les mus&eacute;es qui rendent accessibles au public une partie de leurs collections, de nombreuses bases de donn&eacute;es sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es, par exemple sur les terra sigillata ou les pi&egrave;ces de monnaie, sont &eacute;galement disponibles en ligne. Dans certains pays, comme la Norv&egrave;ge, une grande partie des d&eacute;couvertes arch&eacute;ologiques sont syst&eacute;matiquement publi&eacute;es dans une base de donn&eacute;es en ligne pour une exploitation ult&eacute;rieure.L&rsquo;&eacute;valuation automatis&eacute;e de grands ensembles de donn&eacute;es non tri&eacute;es, qui est associ&eacute;e &agrave; l&rsquo;expression &#x201e;Big data&ldquo;, a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re judicieuse &agrave; plusieurs reprises, comme le montre le projet NEOMINE ou le projet &#x201e;ancient places&ldquo; d&rsquo;Alphabet Inc. Un rejet global de grandes collections d&rsquo;objets et de donn&eacute;es reste incompr&eacute;hensible au vu des possibilit&eacute;s et surtout des m&eacute;thodes d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;tablies dans les sciences naturelles et devrait &ecirc;tre reconsid&eacute;r&eacute; en faveur d&rsquo;une vision plus objective et, bien s&ucirc;r, non d&eacute;pourvue d&rsquo;esprit critique des nouvelles m&eacute;thodes de recherche."

The effects of IT convergence-contents were analyzed on the occupational performance of the elderly. This investigation was done with 100 elderly people above 65 years of age who lived in local community and two senior welfare centers in Busan and Kyeongbuk. The 100 elderly people were split into two groups of 50: the one group who has experience with IT convergence-contents was the experiment group, and the other group with no experience was the control group. In both groups, body functions, cognitive functions, activities of daily living and community participation were tested. The experimental group had higher scores for cognitive function, and activities of daily living than that of the control group. In conclusion, future studies can support continued IT convergence-contents at the local business community level rather than with smaller samples.

From such perspective, this study found examples of the services in the IT convergence industries and the application technologies for the realization of those services; and conducted a research based on the examples, using the technical Characteristics classification; and based on the result, analyzed the standards and the peculiarity of technologies employed for the IT convergence service and the correlation and the complementarity between them; also identified the standards and the peculiarity of technologies required by the IT convergence services and analyzed the correlation between them; and finally analyzed the compatibility between the IT convergence services and the applied technologies. The conclusion of this study is expected to be utilized for selecting technologies for the introduction and the operation of the optimal IT convergence service and as a benchmark as well."

AI 사용 여부의 공개에 대해서는 콘텐츠 가치유형에 관계없이 지켜야 할 원칙으로 인식되었으나, 실용적 콘텐츠에 대해 그러한 인식이 더 강하게 드러났다. 본 연구는 AI 활용의 투명성과 진정성을 제고하는 방안이 필요함을 시사하며, 향후 AI의 발전과 활용이 소비자 인식에 미치는 영향을 지속적으로 연구할 필요가 있음을 강조한다."

Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities. This innovation guarantees intuitive monitoring of vaccination progress and curtailment of COVID-19 spread through compliance enforcement."

Thus, analysis has continued for a long time in the quantity and quality of data, and there are changes in the location of data in the social sciences, past trends and the emergence of big data. The introduction of big data is presented as a prototype of new social science and is a useful practical example that empirically shows the need, basis, and direction of analysis through trend prediction services. Big data provides a future perspective as an important foundation for social change within the framework of basic social sciences."
