The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field.

          "text": "Machine learning political orders Machine learning political orders Machine learning political orders AbstractA significant set of epistemic and political transformations are taking place as states and societies begin to understand themselves and their problems through the paradigm of deep neural network algorithms. A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data."

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores."

          "text": "Machine learning political orders Machine learning political orders Machine learning political orders AbstractA significant set of epistemic and political transformations are taking place as states and societies begin to understand themselves and their problems through the paradigm of deep neural network algorithms. A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data."
