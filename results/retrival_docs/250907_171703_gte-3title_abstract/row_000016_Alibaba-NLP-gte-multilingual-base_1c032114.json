SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

Dans certains pays, comme la Norv&egrave;ge, une grande partie des d&eacute;couvertes arch&eacute;ologiques sont syst&eacute;matiquement publi&eacute;es dans une base de donn&eacute;es en ligne pour une exploitation ult&eacute;rieure.L&rsquo;&eacute;valuation automatis&eacute;e de grands ensembles de donn&eacute;es non tri&eacute;es, qui est associ&eacute;e &agrave; l&rsquo;expression &#x201e;Big data&ldquo;, a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re judicieuse &agrave; plusieurs reprises, comme le montre le projet NEOMINE ou le projet &#x201e;ancient places&ldquo; d&rsquo;Alphabet Inc.

To fulfill the potential of energy big data and obtain insights to achieve smart energy management, we present a comprehensive study of big data driven smart energy management. We first discuss the sources and characteristics of energy big data. Also, a process model of big data driven smart energy management is proposed. Then taking smart grid as the research background, we provide a systematic review of big data analytics for smart energy management. It is discussed from four major aspects, namely power generation side management, microgrid and renewable energy management, asset management and collaborative operation, as well as demand side management (DSM). Afterwards, the industrial development of big data-driven smart energy management is analyzed and discussed. Finally, we point out the challenges of big data-driven smart energy management in IT infrastructure, data collection and governance, data integration and sharing, processing and analysis, security and privacy, and professionals."

          "text": "Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review AbstractValue Chain has been considered as a key model for managing efficiently value creation processes within organizations. However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities."

SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie. Outre les mus&eacute;es qui rendent accessibles au public une partie de leurs collections, de nombreuses bases de donn&eacute;es sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es, par exemple sur les terra sigillata ou les pi&egrave;ces de monnaie, sont &eacute;galement disponibles en ligne. Dans certains pays, comme la Norv&egrave;ge, une grande partie des d&eacute;couvertes arch&eacute;ologiques sont syst&eacute;matiquement publi&eacute;es dans une base de donn&eacute;es en ligne pour une exploitation ult&eacute;rieure.L&rsquo;&eacute;valuation automatis&eacute;e de grands ensembles de donn&eacute;es non tri&eacute;es, qui est associ&eacute;e &agrave; l&rsquo;expression &#x201e;Big data&ldquo;, a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re judicieuse &agrave; plusieurs reprises, comme le montre le projet NEOMINE ou le projet &#x201e;ancient places&ldquo; d&rsquo;Alphabet Inc. Un rejet global de grandes collections d&rsquo;objets et de donn&eacute;es reste incompr&eacute;hensible au vu des possibilit&eacute;s et surtout des m&eacute;thodes d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;tablies dans les sciences naturelles et devrait &ecirc;tre reconsid&eacute;r&eacute; en faveur d&rsquo;une vision plus objective et, bien s&ucirc;r, non d&eacute;pourvue d&rsquo;esprit critique des nouvelles m&eacute;thodes de recherche."

Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems."
