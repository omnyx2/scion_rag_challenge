It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both."

Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem."
