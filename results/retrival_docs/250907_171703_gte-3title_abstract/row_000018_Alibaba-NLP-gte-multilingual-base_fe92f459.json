          "text": "Protecting Privacy in Big Data Protecting Privacy in Big Data Protecting Privacy in Big Data In an age of big data, privacy is more essential than ever before, but if we are to protect it effectively, while continuing to enjoy the benefits that big data is already making possible, we need to evolve better, faster, and more scalable mechanisms.The following are the four core elements critical to effective governance of big data.First, a transformation of the current approach to a risk management approach that places more responsibility for data stewardship, and liability for reasonably foreseeable harms, on the users of data rather than using notice and consent to shift the burden to individuals seems critical. This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data."

Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches.

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another."

However, analyzing and processing this information could cause revealing and disclosing some sensitive and personal information when the information is contained in applications that are correlated to users such as location-based services, but concerns are diminished if the applications are correlated to general information such as scientific results. In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data."
