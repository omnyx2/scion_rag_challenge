This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined."

The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges."

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). AI and ML have repeatedly shown how they revolutionise entire industries and sectors. The RecAIcle project focuses on plastic and battery characterisation and sorting. Thus, the productivity and quality of manual sorting are to be increased, and a digital assistance system that supports sorting employees in their sorting decisions is being developed for this purpose. Due to the unique requirements of such a system, the framework design was adapted accordingly. For the development of this system, advanced, life-long learning ML models are needed, which in turn require large amounts of high-quality training data and computing power. In order to provide sufficient use-case-specific training data, experiments were carried out under controlled conditions on a pilot plant scale for training data acquisition. The results of the system design process and the first training data acquisition are presented in this paper. An outlook on future developments and further planned trials is also given."

Recently, the performance improvement of the application processor of smartphones has become an opportunity for the machine learning platform to move from the cloud to On-Device AI, and mobile applications equipped with machine learning functions are required. In this paper, machine learning tools for mobile applications are investigated and compared the characteristics of these tools."

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined."

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results. We, therefore, suggest that it further expands the role of science in terrorism research."
