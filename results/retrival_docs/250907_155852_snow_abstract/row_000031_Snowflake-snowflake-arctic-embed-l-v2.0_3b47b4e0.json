The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."

          "text": "컨버전스(Convergence)란 단어는 집합, 집중, 수렴, 한 곳으로 모여짐 등의 뜻을 지닌 일반적인 용어로써 매우 발전해가고 있는 IT 분야에서 다양한 수요자의 욕구와 기술의 진화에 따라 최근에 매우 빈번하게 등장하고 있는 용어이자, 중요한 화두 중에 하나가 되고 있다. 이에 단어가 지니고 있는 일반적 의미를 다각적으로 분석함과 동시에 그 의미가 정보통신분야의 기술적 측면에서 또한 활용적인 측면에서 어떤 암시와 효과를 나타내고 있고, 나아가 IT 분야의 발전을 향한 목표 지향적인 측면에서의 역할이 가능한지와 또 다른 발전과 진화에 따라 어느 정도의 생명력과 경쟁력은 지닐 수 있는지를 살펴보고자 한다. 20세기 후반에 등장한 새로운 산업의 빅뱅이 되고 있는 IT 분야가 전세계로 확산, 발전되어감에 따라 수많은 일반적인 단어와 용어 들이 정보통신분야에서 도입, 활용하였고 이러한 용어들은 단어 자체의 의미 보다는 정보통신분야 발전의 현재와 미래를 규정해왔고, 나아가 정보통신 발전에 따른 혜택을 받는 전세계와 국내의 이용자들에게 많은 변화를 제공함과 동시에 연관분야의 산업에도 긍정적이던 부정적이던지 상호간 막대한 영향을 미쳐왔다고 분석된다. 이에 본 논문 자료는 IT 전문 용어가 아닌 일반적인 용어 중에서 IT 분야의 어떤 형태로든 영향을 미칠 용어 중에서 컨버전스란 단어를 통해 IT 분야의 현주소를 사례를 중심으로 분석, 점검하고 향후 IT 분야에서 컨버전스가 적용될 미래의 발전 모습을 전망하고자 하는데 있다."

This study investigated IT firms' concern about the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems and the role of IT firms in the process with Focus Group Interview and in-depth interview on executives of IT firms, and classified the concern to three major issues. They are the clarification of IT firms' role in the defense IT-convergent efforts, the establishment of the control tower for defense IT convergence, and reasonable estimation of software development cost in the defense acquisition process."

          "text": "Many scholars have addressed the technological convergence of small-medium sized firms in Korea and their impact on the economic growth of nation. Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."

Especially, IT convergence have been one of the most important innovative way for defense sector. Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and have been applying it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. Recently, the creative vitamin project has been launched. Vitamin 'D' means the way to create the value of defense industry. This research analyzes and evaluates various IT convergence business models based on an operation of defense IT convergence center from 2011 to 2014, which is the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence business models can be classified into four types of mission area as follows : weapon acquisition and management, military intelligence, military power construction, and resources management. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and describe the framework and processes for applying IT to the defense sector. We analyzes and evaluates various business models designed through defense IT convergence framework and processes."

This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area.NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."
