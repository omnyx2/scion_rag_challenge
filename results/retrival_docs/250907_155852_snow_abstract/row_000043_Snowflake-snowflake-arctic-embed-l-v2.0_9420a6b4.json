The education industry is also leveraging artificial intelligence magical power. Uses of digital technologies in pedagogical paradigms are being observed from the last century. The widespread involvement of artificial intelligence starts reshaping the educational landscape. Adaptive learning is an emerging pedagogical technique that uses computer-based algorithms, tools, and technologies for the learning process. These intelligent practices help at each learning curve stage, from content development to student's exam evaluation. The quality of information technology students and professionals training has also improved drastically with the involvement of artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we will investigate adopted digital methods in the education sector so far. We will focus on intelligent techniques adopted for information technology students and professionals. Our literature review works on our proposed framework that entails four categories. These categories are communication between teacher and student, improved content design for computing course, evaluation of student's performance and intelligent agent. Our research will present the role of artificial intelligence in reshaping the educational process."

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

          "text": "Artificial Intelligence has stimulated every aspect of today's life. Human thinking quality is trying to be involved through digital tools in all research areas of the modern era. The education industry is also leveraging artificial intelligence magical power. Uses of digital technologies in pedagogical paradigms are being observed from the last century. The widespread involvement of artificial intelligence starts reshaping the educational landscape. Adaptive learning is an emerging pedagogical technique that uses computer-based algorithms, tools, and technologies for the learning process. These intelligent practices help at each learning curve stage, from content development to student's exam evaluation. The quality of information technology students and professionals training has also improved drastically with the involvement of artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we will investigate adopted digital methods in the education sector so far. We will focus on intelligent techniques adopted for information technology students and professionals. Our literature review works on our proposed framework that entails four categories. These categories are communication between teacher and student, improved content design for computing course, evaluation of student's performance and intelligent agent. Our research will present the role of artificial intelligence in reshaping the educational process."

In particular, various algorithms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, are continuously being improved. Among these algorithms, the expansion of deep learning is rapidly changing. Nevertheless, machine learning algorithms have not yet been applied in several fields, such as personal authentication technology. This technology is an essential tool in the digital information era, walking recognition technology as promising biometrics, and technology for solving state-space problems. Therefore, algorithm technologies of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, which are typical machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as agricultural technology, personal authentication, wireless network, game, biometric recognition, and image recognition, are being improved and expanded in this paper."

This article aims to introduce ANN and its mathematical principle to the field of applied linguistics. An ANN consists of input, hidden, and output vectors and the vectors are connected to one another by weight matrices. Mapping from input to output is accounted for by simple matrix multiplication."
