Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another."

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data."

          "text": "AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient."

A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation. This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition."

For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time."

          "text": "In recent innovation trends, one notable feature is the merging and overlapping of technologies: in other words, technological convergence. A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."
