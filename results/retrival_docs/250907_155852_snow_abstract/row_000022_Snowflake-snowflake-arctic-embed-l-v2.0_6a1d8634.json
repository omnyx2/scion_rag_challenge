The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem."
