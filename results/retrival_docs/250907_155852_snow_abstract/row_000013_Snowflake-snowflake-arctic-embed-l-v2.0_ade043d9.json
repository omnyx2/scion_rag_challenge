          "text": "In an age of big data, privacy is more essential than ever before, but if we are to protect it effectively, while continuing to enjoy the benefits that big data is already making possible, we need to evolve better, faster, and more scalable mechanisms.The following are the four core elements critical to effective governance of big data.First, a transformation of the current approach to a risk management approach that places more responsibility for data stewardship, and liability for reasonably foreseeable harms, on the users of data rather than using notice and consent to shift the burden to individuals seems critical. This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data."

In this paper, we provide a framework for developing practical and reasonable data sharing policies that incorporate the sociological, financial, technical and scientific requirements of a sustainable Big Data dependent scientific community.FindingsMany biomedical and healthcare studies may be significantly impacted by using large, heterogeneous and incongruent datasets; however there are significant technical, social, regulatory, and institutional barriers that need to be overcome to ensure the power of Big Data overcomes these detrimental factors.ConclusionsPragmatic policies that demand extensive sharing of data, promotion of data fusion, provenance, interoperability and balance security and protection of personal information are critical for the long term impact of translational Big Data analytics."

Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both."

Here, qualia are redefined in a more general way. It is argued that the redefined qualia will be essential to the mind-body problem, the problem of consciousness and also to the symbol grounding problem, which is inherent in physical symbol systems. Then, it is argued that the redefined qualia are necessary for Artificial Intelligence systems for the operation with meanings. Finally, it is proposed that robots with qualia may be conscious."
