[1972] What Computers Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Dreyfus, H. [1992] What Computers Still Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Searle, J. [1980] Minds, brains and programs, Behav. Brain Sci.3, 417-457; Searle, J. [1984] Minds, Brains and Sciences (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA); Searle, J. [1992] The Rediscovery of the Mind (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA); Fodor, J. [2002] The Mind Doesn&rsquo;t Work that Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).). The technical improvements of machine learning and deep learning, though, have been continuing and many breakthroughs have occurred recently. This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J. [1996] Mind and World (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), imaginative understanding (Campbell, J. [2020] Causation in Psychology (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), and animal knowledge (Sosa, E. [2007] A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge, volume 1 (Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK); Sosa, E. [2015] Judgment and Agency (Oxford University Press, Cambridge, MA)). Moreover, I will explore whether and in what way neuroscience-inspired AI and predictive coding (Hassabis, D., Kumaran, D., Summerfield, C., &amp; Botvinick, M. [2017] Neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence, Neuron95(2), 245-258) can help carry out this project."

          "text": "AbstractThe advent of radiomics has revolutionized medical image analysis, affording the extraction of high dimensional quantitative data for the detailed examination of normal and abnormal tissues. Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for the enhancement of a series of steps in the radiomics pipeline, from image acquisition and preprocessing, to segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model development. The aim of this review is to present the most used AI methods for radiomics analysis, explaining the advantages and limitations of the methods. Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption. Importantly, this review will aim to highlight how AI can assist radiomics in overcoming major bottlenecks in clinical implementation, ultimately improving the translation potential of the method."

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."
