With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

The education industry is also leveraging artificial intelligence magical power. Uses of digital technologies in pedagogical paradigms are being observed from the last century. The widespread involvement of artificial intelligence starts reshaping the educational landscape. Adaptive learning is an emerging pedagogical technique that uses computer-based algorithms, tools, and technologies for the learning process. These intelligent practices help at each learning curve stage, from content development to student's exam evaluation. The quality of information technology students and professionals training has also improved drastically with the involvement of artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we will investigate adopted digital methods in the education sector so far. We will focus on intelligent techniques adopted for information technology students and professionals. Our literature review works on our proposed framework that entails four categories. These categories are communication between teacher and student, improved content design for computing course, evaluation of student's performance and intelligent agent. Our research will present the role of artificial intelligence in reshaping the educational process."

          "text": "At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

This article aims to introduce ANN and its mathematical principle to the field of applied linguistics. An ANN consists of input, hidden, and output vectors and the vectors are connected to one another by weight matrices. Mapping from input to output is accounted for by simple matrix multiplication."

          "text": "Statistical Machine Learning has undergone a phase transition from a pure academic endeavor to being one of the main drivers of modern commerce and science. Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

          "text": "AbstractBackgroundIncreasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."
