It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies. Additionally, we propose methods to improve and promote the certification programs based on the results. These findings provide new knowledge and insights that contribute to the development of AI-based product certification programs."

In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies. The paper also looks at content, its delivery, data and metadata, and the implications for a better world built on the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) for 2030 enacted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN)."

[1972] What Computers Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Dreyfus, H. [1992] What Computers Still Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Searle, J. [1980] Minds, brains and programs, Behav.

[2002] The Mind Doesn&rsquo;t Work that Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).). The technical improvements of machine learning and deep learning, though, have been continuing and many breakthroughs have occurred recently. This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J. [1996] Mind and World (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), imaginative understanding (Campbell, J.

[2007] A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge, volume 1 (Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK); Sosa, E. [2015] Judgment and Agency (Oxford University Press, Cambridge, MA)). Moreover, I will explore whether and in what way neuroscience-inspired AI and predictive coding (Hassabis, D., Kumaran, D., Summerfield, C., &amp; Botvinick, M. [2017] Neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence, Neuron95(2), 245-258) can help carry out this project."

          "text": "Human- versus Artificial Intelligence Human- versus Artificial Intelligence Human- versus Artificial Intelligence AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously. For this purpose a first framework for educational content is proposed."

          "text": "Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk have become popular for a wide variety of human intelligence tasks; however, quality control continues to be a significant challenge. Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment. The presentation will conclude with a set of requirements and a summary of recommendations for future priorities."

SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."

[2002] The Mind Doesn&rsquo;t Work that Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).). The technical improvements of machine learning and deep learning, though, have been continuing and many breakthroughs have occurred recently. This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J. [1996] Mind and World (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), imaginative understanding (Campbell, J.

[2007] A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge, volume 1 (Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK); Sosa, E. [2015] Judgment and Agency (Oxford University Press, Cambridge, MA)). Moreover, I will explore whether and in what way neuroscience-inspired AI and predictive coding (Hassabis, D., Kumaran, D., Summerfield, C., &amp; Botvinick, M.

Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience.

Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly."

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

          "text": "Human- versus Artificial Intelligence Human- versus Artificial Intelligence Human- versus Artificial Intelligence AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously. For this purpose a first framework for educational content is proposed."
