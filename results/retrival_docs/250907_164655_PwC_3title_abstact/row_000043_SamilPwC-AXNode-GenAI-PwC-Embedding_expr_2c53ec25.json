This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined."

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model."

In particular, various algorithms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, are continuously being improved. Among these algorithms, the expansion of deep learning is rapidly changing. Nevertheless, machine learning algorithms have not yet been applied in several fields, such as personal authentication technology. This technology is an essential tool in the digital information era, walking recognition technology as promising biometrics, and technology for solving state-space problems. Therefore, algorithm technologies of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, which are typical machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as agricultural technology, personal authentication, wireless network, game, biometric recognition, and image recognition, are being improved and expanded in this paper."

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

The world is moving at a fast pace having the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all the major disciplines and the educational sector is also not untouched by its impact especially in an online learning environment. This paper attempts to elaborate on the benefits of ML and AI in E-Learning (EL) in general and explain how King Khalid University (KKU) EL Deanship is making the best of ML and AI in its practices. Also, researchers have focused on the future of ML and AI in any academic program. This research is descriptive in nature; results are based on qualitative analysis done through tools and techniques of EL applied in KKU as an example but the same modus operandi can be implemented by any institution in its EL platform. KKU is using Learning Management Services (LMS) for providing online learning practices and Blackboard (BB) for sharing online learning resources, therefore these tools are considered by the researchers for explaining the results of ML and AI."

          "text": "Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk have become popular for a wide variety of human intelligence tasks; however, quality control continues to be a significant challenge. Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

Human thinking quality is trying to be involved through digital tools in all research areas of the modern era. The education industry is also leveraging artificial intelligence magical power. Uses of digital technologies in pedagogical paradigms are being observed from the last century. The widespread involvement of artificial intelligence starts reshaping the educational landscape. Adaptive learning is an emerging pedagogical technique that uses computer-based algorithms, tools, and technologies for the learning process. These intelligent practices help at each learning curve stage, from content development to student's exam evaluation. The quality of information technology students and professionals training has also improved drastically with the involvement of artificial intelligence systems. In this paper, we will investigate adopted digital methods in the education sector so far. We will focus on intelligent techniques adopted for information technology students and professionals. Our literature review works on our proposed framework that entails four categories. These categories are communication between teacher and student, improved content design for computing course, evaluation of student's performance and intelligent agent. Our research will present the role of artificial intelligence in reshaping the educational process."

          "text": "MACHINE LEARNING MACHINE LEARNING MACHINE LEARNING The motivation for machine learning is to have computers extract concepts and relations from databases or through interactive sessions with a user and then use them in any knowledge-intensive activity. Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given."

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model."
