With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

The accuracy of artificial intelligence depends on the amount of learning data and the appropriate algorithm. However, it is not easy to obtain learning data with a large number of entity. Less data set have large generalization errors due to overfitting. In order to minimize this generalization error, this study proposed DGA which can expect relatively high accuracy even though data with a less data set is applied to machine learning based genetic algorithm to deep learning based dropout. The idea of this paper is to determine the active state of the nodes. Using Gradient about loss function, A new fitness function is defined. Proposed Algorithm DGA is supplementing stochastic inconsistency about Dropout. Also DGA solved problem by the complexity of the fitness function and expression range of the model about Genetic Algorithm As a result of experiments using MNIST data proposed algorithm accuracy is 75.3%. Using only Dropout algorithm accuracy is 41.4%. It is shown that DGA is better than using only dropout."

Deep learning에 적합한 데이터 유형인지에 대한 정량적인 판단이 어렵다.&amp;#xD; 본 논문에서는, 상기 언급된 한계를 개선하는 새로운 COF양산 검사 시스템을 제안한다. 제안하는 방법은 불량 Feature의 ROI를 보다 정교하게 추출할 수 있는 방법 중 하나인 Inpainting기법의 접목, 이를 불량 유형에 맞게 CNN 혹은 전통적 Image processing을 사용할지를 결정하는 정량적인 Parameterize score의 설계, 그리고 Heuristic하게 구성된 DL기반의 이미지 판정 기법으로 구성된다. 제안된 양산 검사 시스템은 기존 광학검사를 대체하여, 기존대비 성능을 200% 이상 향상시켰으며, 불량 허용치를 0.00003% 이내인 30ppm 수준으로 요구 수준을 달성하였다. 제안되는 방법은 국내 COF 생산 기업의 공장의 양산 검사 시스템에 실제로 접목되었으며, 현재도 공장 내 Process의 하나로 자리 잡고 비용절감에 지속적으로 기여하고 있다."

The accuracy of artificial intelligence depends on the amount of learning data and the appropriate algorithm. However, it is not easy to obtain learning data with a large number of entity. Less data set have large generalization errors due to overfitting. In order to minimize this generalization error, this study proposed DGA which can expect relatively high accuracy even though data with a less data set is applied to machine learning based genetic algorithm to deep learning based dropout. The idea of this paper is to determine the active state of the nodes. Using Gradient about loss function, A new fitness function is defined. Proposed Algorithm DGA is supplementing stochastic inconsistency about Dropout. Also DGA solved problem by the complexity of the fitness function and expression range of the model about Genetic Algorithm As a result of experiments using MNIST data proposed algorithm accuracy is 75.3%. Using only Dropout algorithm accuracy is 41.4%. It is shown that DGA is better than using only dropout."

In particular, various algorithms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, are continuously being improved. Among these algorithms, the expansion of deep learning is rapidly changing. Nevertheless, machine learning algorithms have not yet been applied in several fields, such as personal authentication technology. This technology is an essential tool in the digital information era, walking recognition technology as promising biometrics, and technology for solving state-space problems. Therefore, algorithm technologies of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, which are typical machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as agricultural technology, personal authentication, wireless network, game, biometric recognition, and image recognition, are being improved and expanded in this paper."

Neural-net computing on the other hand seems to be better suited to meeting the demands of those types of tasks. These matters are discussed in this paper and it is suggested that the type of Artificial Intelligence appropriate for use in an engineering system will be an evolved one combining the strengths of symbolic processing and neural-net computing."

Auch wenn sie durch verschiedene algorithmische Fortschritte begleitet wird, ist diese Technik vor allem aus Anwendungssicht &#x201e;disruptiv“: Sie verschiebt die Grenze automatisierbarer Aufgaben betr&auml;chtlich, ver&auml;ndert die Art der Produktentwicklung und steht praktisch jedermann zur Verf&uuml;gung. Gegenstand des Deep Learning sind neuronale Netze mit einer großen Anzahl von Schichten. Verglichen mit fr&uuml;heren Ans&auml;tzen mit idealerweise einer einzigen Schicht, erlaubt dies den Einsatz massiver Rechenhardware, um Black-Box-Modelle mit einem Minimum an Entwicklungsaufwand direkt aus Rohdaten zu trainieren. Die meisten erfolgreichen Anwendungen finden sich in der Auswertung visueller Bilder, aber auch in der Audio- und Text-Modellierung."
