Against this background, it is urgent to establish policy measures to survive and spread export products in the global industries.Research, design, data and methodology - In order to achieve this goal, we conducted the Importance - Performance Analysis (IPA) and found that it is necessary to develop tailor - made marketing support for small and medium sized IT exporters and to develop export strategy products with competitive technologies.Results - Above all, customized marketing support for IT export-related SMEs was needed. Next, in the first quadrant, strategic products, qualitative level, global, value added, and information systems were included, and it was found that 'development of export strategic products with competitive technologies' was necessary. In the third quadrant, related variables calculated at present time are not urgent variables.Conclusions - In this study, it would be necessary to calculate the additional implications of the variables that are not considered in this study, including future studies, because the methods considered here as analysis variables are carried out in comparison with the previous studies."

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."

This study investigated IT firms' concern about the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems and the role of IT firms in the process with Focus Group Interview and in-depth interview on executives of IT firms, and classified the concern to three major issues. They are the clarification of IT firms' role in the defense IT-convergent efforts, the establishment of the control tower for defense IT convergence, and reasonable estimation of software development cost in the defense acquisition process."

Especially, IT convergence have been one of the most important innovative way for defense sector. Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and have been applying it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. Recently, the creative vitamin project has been launched. Vitamin 'D' means the way to create the value of defense industry. This research analyzes and evaluates various IT convergence business models based on an operation of defense IT convergence center from 2011 to 2014, which is the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence business models can be classified into four types of mission area as follows : weapon acquisition and management, military intelligence, military power construction, and resources management. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and describe the framework and processes for applying IT to the defense sector. We analyzes and evaluates various business models designed through defense IT convergence framework and processes."

From such perspective, this study found examples of the services in the IT convergence industries and the application technologies for the realization of those services; and conducted a research based on the examples, using the technical Characteristics classification; and based on the result, analyzed the standards and the peculiarity of technologies employed for the IT convergence service and the correlation and the complementarity between them; also identified the standards and the peculiarity of technologies required by the IT convergence services and analyzed the correlation between them; and finally analyzed the compatibility between the IT convergence services and the applied technologies. The conclusion of this study is expected to be utilized for selecting technologies for the introduction and the operation of the optimal IT convergence service and as a benchmark as well."

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."
