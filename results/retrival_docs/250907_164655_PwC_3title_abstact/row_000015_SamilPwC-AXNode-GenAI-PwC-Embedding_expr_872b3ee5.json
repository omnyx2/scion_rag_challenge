Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another."

Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems."

We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data. This essay elaborates on the ways Big Data impacts on ethical conceptions."

          "text": "Synchrotron Big Data Science Synchrotron Big Data Science Synchrotron Big Data Science AbstractThe rapid development of synchrotrons has massively increased the speed at which experiments can be performed, while new techniques have increased the amount of raw data collected during each experiment. While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage. These effects, collectively known as the &ldquo;data deluge,&rdquo; affect synchrotrons in several different ways including fast data collection, available local storage, data management systems, and curation of the data. This review highlights the Big Data strategies adopted nowadays at synchrotrons, documenting this novel and promising hybridization between science and technology, which promise a dramatic increase in the number of scientific discoveries."

It then explains how this material and situated character of data raises questions concerning the ethics of the increasingly fashionable Big Data discourses. It argues that attention should be paid to (1) the vocabulary currently used when discussing the governance of data initiatives; (2) the internal tension between current data initiatives and environmental policies; (3) issues of fair distribution.

Against this background, it is urgent to establish policy measures to survive and spread export products in the global industries.Research, design, data and methodology - In order to achieve this goal, we conducted the Importance - Performance Analysis (IPA) and found that it is necessary to develop tailor - made marketing support for small and medium sized IT exporters and to develop export strategy products with competitive technologies.Results - Above all, customized marketing support for IT export-related SMEs was needed. Next, in the first quadrant, strategic products, qualitative level, global, value added, and information systems were included, and it was found that 'development of export strategic products with competitive technologies' was necessary. In the third quadrant, related variables calculated at present time are not urgent variables.Conclusions - In this study, it would be necessary to calculate the additional implications of the variables that are not considered in this study, including future studies, because the methods considered here as analysis variables are carried out in comparison with the previous studies."

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

The effects of IT convergence-contents were analyzed on the occupational performance of the elderly. This investigation was done with 100 elderly people above 65 years of age who lived in local community and two senior welfare centers in Busan and Kyeongbuk. The 100 elderly people were split into two groups of 50: the one group who has experience with IT convergence-contents was the experiment group, and the other group with no experience was the control group. In both groups, body functions, cognitive functions, activities of daily living and community participation were tested. The experimental group had higher scores for cognitive function, and activities of daily living than that of the control group. In conclusion, future studies can support continued IT convergence-contents at the local business community level rather than with smaller samples. This work lays the groundwork for follow-up studies to evaluate the effectiveness of IT convergence-contents."

          "text": "Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time."

          "text": "Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk have become popular for a wide variety of human intelligence tasks; however, quality control continues to be a significant challenge. Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

The lack of collaboration between IT teams and those in charge of industrial or operational technology (OT) is also a hindrance to cyber security for companies wishing to take full advantage of IT/OT convergence to increase their competitiveness."
