Especially, IT convergence have been one of the most important innovative way for defense sector. Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and have been applying it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. Recently, the creative vitamin project has been launched. Vitamin 'D' means the way to create the value of defense industry. This research analyzes and evaluates various IT convergence business models based on an operation of defense IT convergence center from 2011 to 2014, which is the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence business models can be classified into four types of mission area as follows : weapon acquisition and management, military intelligence, military power construction, and resources management. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and describe the framework and processes for applying IT to the defense sector. We analyzes and evaluates various business models designed through defense IT convergence framework and processes."

At the viewpoint, advanced distribution management system (ADMS) to have the new concepts and to increase distribution system operation efficiency through global information and functions from the other systems has been proposed.In order to implement the ADMS, IT and OT have to be employed together on the ADMS; and the concept-based IT/OT convergence concept has been presented. Therefore, this paper introduces ADMS and IT/OT convergence and proposes a design of IT/OT convergence based ADMS system design with configurations and functions."

The lack of collaboration between IT teams and those in charge of industrial or operational technology (OT) is also a hindrance to cyber security for companies wishing to take full advantage of IT/OT convergence to increase their competitiveness."
