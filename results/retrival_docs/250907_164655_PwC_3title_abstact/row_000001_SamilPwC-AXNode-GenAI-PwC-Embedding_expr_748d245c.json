It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

The purpose of the current research paper was to find out the best artificial intelligence tools for undergraduate students that may be used to enhance their learning results and also discover what students use AI tools for. Method: The purpose was achieved by adopting a survey design to collect data that was analyzed statistically using percentages and pie charts. Findings: The study found out that undergraduate students use ChatGPT, Grammarly, Meta AI, ELSA Speak, Notion AI, BlackBox, Tome.APP, Tabnine, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, AI Notes, Phatomath, Midjourney, StarryAI, Murf, Runway, Copy.AI, Durable or Soundful in their learning process.

The AI tools also organize tasks, review answers, and instruct how to go about answering given tasks. Conclusion and Recommendation: The use of numerous AI tools by undergraduate students enhances learning. The upscaling of AI tool usage requires universities to focus their efforts on integrating AI into their curricula and offering regular training sessions, and workshops. They should also foster continuous research and development in AI and continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI tools and their impact on the performances of students."

Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

More so, artificial intelligence is gaining wide adoption as it aims to enhance the learning outcomes of students. The purpose of the current research paper was to find out the best artificial intelligence tools for undergraduate students that may be used to enhance their learning results and also discover what students use AI tools for. Method: The purpose was achieved by adopting a survey design to collect data that was analyzed statistically using percentages and pie charts. Findings: The study found out that undergraduate students use ChatGPT, Grammarly, Meta AI, ELSA Speak, Notion AI, BlackBox, Tome.APP, Tabnine, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, AI Notes, Phatomath, Midjourney, StarryAI, Murf, Runway, Copy.AI, Durable or Soundful in their learning process. Such AI tools help them gain a better understanding of the topics related to their study, do assignments, create content faster, write a certain piece of content, get feedback on a given content, and do its translation. The AI tools also organize tasks, review answers, and instruct how to go about answering given tasks. Conclusion and Recommendation: The use of numerous AI tools by undergraduate students enhances learning. The upscaling of AI tool usage requires universities to focus their efforts on integrating AI into their curricula and offering regular training sessions, and workshops. They should also foster continuous research and development in AI and continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI tools and their impact on the performances of students."

Understanding these basic concepts is becoming increasingly important as kids don't have the opportunity to explore AI processes and improve their understanding of basic machine learning concepts and their essential components. Machine learning educational tools can help children easily understand artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this paper, we examine machine learning education tools and compare their features."

Logical languages are widely used for expressing the declarative knowledge needed in artificial intelligence systems. Symbolic logic also provides a clear semantics for knowledge representation languages and a methodology for analyzing and comparing deductive inference techniques. Several observations gained from experience with the approach are discussed. Finally, we confront some challenging problems for artificial intelligence and describe what is being done in an attempt to solve them."

The world is moving at a fast pace having the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all the major disciplines and the educational sector is also not untouched by its impact especially in an online learning environment. This paper attempts to elaborate on the benefits of ML and AI in E-Learning (EL) in general and explain how King Khalid University (KKU) EL Deanship is making the best of ML and AI in its practices. Also, researchers have focused on the future of ML and AI in any academic program. This research is descriptive in nature; results are based on qualitative analysis done through tools and techniques of EL applied in KKU as an example but the same modus operandi can be implemented by any institution in its EL platform. KKU is using Learning Management Services (LMS) for providing online learning practices and Blackboard (BB) for sharing online learning resources, therefore these tools are considered by the researchers for explaining the results of ML and AI."
