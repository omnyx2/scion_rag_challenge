A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

Especially, IT convergence have been one of the most important innovative way for defense sector. Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and have been applying it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. Recently, the creative vitamin project has been launched. Vitamin 'D' means the way to create the value of defense industry. This research analyzes and evaluates various IT convergence business models based on an operation of defense IT convergence center from 2011 to 2014, which is the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence business models can be classified into four types of mission area as follows : weapon acquisition and management, military intelligence, military power construction, and resources management. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and describe the framework and processes for applying IT to the defense sector. We analyzes and evaluates various business models designed through defense IT convergence framework and processes."

Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities. This innovation guarantees intuitive monitoring of vaccination progress and curtailment of COVID-19 spread through compliance enforcement."

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area. NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."

From such perspective, this study found examples of the services in the IT convergence industries and the application technologies for the realization of those services; and conducted a research based on the examples, using the technical Characteristics classification; and based on the result, analyzed the standards and the peculiarity of technologies employed for the IT convergence service and the correlation and the complementarity between them; also identified the standards and the peculiarity of technologies required by the IT convergence services and analyzed the correlation between them; and finally analyzed the compatibility between the IT convergence services and the applied technologies. The conclusion of this study is expected to be utilized for selecting technologies for the introduction and the operation of the optimal IT convergence service and as a benchmark as well."
