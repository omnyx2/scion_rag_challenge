With Normalization Process Theory in place, this study conducts socio-technical evaluation on the big data phenomenon to understand the developmental processes through which new practices of thinking and enacting are implemented, embedded, and integrated in South Korea. It also undertakes empirical analyses of user modeling to explore the factors influencing users' adoption of big data by integrating cognitive motivations as well as user values as the primary determining factors. Based on the qualitative and quantitative findings, this study concludes that big data should be developed with user-centered ideas and that users should be the focus of big data design.
