It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation. This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

Artificial Intelligence in Nephrology: How Can Artificial Intelligence Augment Nephrologists’ Intelligence? Artificial Intelligence in Nephrology: How Can Artificial Intelligence Augment Nephrologists’ Intelligence? Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) now plays a critical role in almost every area of our daily lives and academic disciplines due to the growth of computing power, advances in methods and techniques, and the explosion of the amount of data; medicine is not an exception. Rather than replacing clinicians, AI is augmenting the intelligence of clinicians in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. Summary: Kidney disease is a substantial medical and public health burden globally, with both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease bringing about high morbidity and mortality as well as a huge economic burden. Even though the existing research and applied works have made certain contributions to more accurate prediction and better understanding of histologic pathology, there is a lot more work to be done and problems to solve. Key Messages: AI applications of diagnostics and prognostics for high-prevalence and high-morbidity types of nephropathy in medical-resource-inadequate areas need special attention; high-volume and high-quality data need to be collected and prepared; a consensus on ethics and safety in the use of AI technologies needs to be built."

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges."

It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation. This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition."

Neural-net computing on the other hand seems to be better suited to meeting the demands of those types of tasks. These matters are discussed in this paper and it is suggested that the type of Artificial Intelligence appropriate for use in an engineering system will be an evolved one combining the strengths of symbolic processing and neural-net computing."

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

This paper describes the work to learn and assess whether a given wine sample is of good quality or not. The use of machine learning techniques specifically the linear regression with stochastic gradient descent were explored, and the features that perform well on this classification were engineered. The main aim is to develop a cost-effective system to acquire knowledge using data analysis through machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine in a better way."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."
