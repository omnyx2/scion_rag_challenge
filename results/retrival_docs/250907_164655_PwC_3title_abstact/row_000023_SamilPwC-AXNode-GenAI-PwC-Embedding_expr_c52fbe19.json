          "text": "Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model."

Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years.

For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

But in practice no model is ever entirely phenomenological or entirely mechanistic. We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient. These domain-specific requirements suggest a need for targeted funding, in which big data technologies for in silico medicine becomes the research priority."

Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model."

Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model."

Various efforts have been made to develop computer-assisted systems to improve the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and acute stroke triage. The widespread emergence of artificial intelligence technology has been integrated into the field of medicine. Artificial intelligence can play an important role in providing care to patients with stroke. In the past few decades, numerous studies have explored the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for application in the management of stroke. In this review, we will start with a brief introduction to machine learning and deep learning and provide clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning in various aspects of stroke management, including rapid diagnosis and improved triage, identifying large vessel occlusion, predicting time from stroke onset, automated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) measurement, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcome. This work is focused on providing the current application of artificial intelligence techniques in the imaging of ischemic stroke, including MRI and CT."

HCI의 대표적인 기술 중 하나는 사용자 감정 인식이다. 감정의 중요성이 증대됨에 따라, 사용자의 감정을 인식하기 위해 얼굴 표정, 제스처, 음성신호, 생리신호, 안구특징 및 멀티 모달리티 (Multi-Modality) 신호를 특징으로 사용하는 방법들이 제안되고 있다. &amp;#xD; 특히, 안구 특징은 사용자가 의도적으로 제어할 수 없으며 컴퓨터가 무의식적인 특징들을 인식할 수 있기 때문에 감정인식에 적합하다. 또한 다양한 분야에 적용될 것으로 기대되는 가상현실과 증강현실을 위해 안구 특징에 기반한 감정인식 기술이 연구되어야 한다.&amp;#xD; 합성곱 신경망 (CNN)과 재귀 신경망 (RNN)과 같은 심층 학습 (Deep learning) 기술들이 다양한 분야에서 성공하고 있으며, 다양한 모달리티들을 이용하는 감정인식 연구에 적용되고 있다. 그러나 다른 모달리티들과 달리, 안구 특징만을 사용하는 심층 학습기반의 감정인식 연구는 매우 부족하다.&amp;#xD; 본 학위논문에서는 시간정보와 동공 크기와 눈 움직임 신호와 같은 안구 특징들만을 이용한 심층 학습 기반의 감정인식 방법을 제안한다.&amp;#xD; 그 과정은 다음과 같다. 먼저, 눈 깜빡임 또는 기술적인 결함으로 인해 발생되는 눈 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 데이터 미획득 구간을 채우기 위한 보간을 수행한다. 그 후 데이터의 길이와 범위를 일치시키기 위해, 신호의 시간과 각 피실험자의 신호들에 대해 정규화를 수행한다. 다음으로 동공 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 시간과 주파수 정보를 분석하기 위해 Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) 특징들을 추출하고, 그 특징들을 결합하여 STFT 특징 결합 영상이라 불리우는 단일 이미지를 생성한다. 마지막으로, valence-arousal 인식을 수행하기 위해, STFT 특징 결합 영상에 적합한 심층 학습 모델을 생성한 후 leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) 방법을 이용하여 제안하는 방법의 성능을 평가한다. &amp;#xD; 대부분의 연구에서, 안구 특징은 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 성능을 향상시키기 위한 보조정보로만 사용하고 있다. 이는 안구 특징이 자극에 민감하고 수동적인 특징 추출방법으로 양질의 특징을 추출하기 어려운 많은 이상치 (Outlier)들을 포함하기 때문이다. 그러나 제안하는 방법의 분류 정확도는 Soleymani [53]가 제안한 결정 수준 융합 (DLF)와 서포트 벡터 머신 (SVM)을 이용한 방법보다 valence와 arousal 감정에 대해 각각 23.6%, 9.8% 향상된 분류 정확도를 달성하였다.&amp;#xD; 실험결과는 제안하는 방법의 효과성을 입증하였고, CNN 모델이 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 방법뿐만 아니라 안구 특징 기반 감정인식에도 효과적이며, 눈 움직임 정보가 valence 감정 인식에도 효과적임을 보였다."
