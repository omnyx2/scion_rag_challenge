Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for the enhancement of a series of steps in the radiomics pipeline, from image acquisition and preprocessing, to segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model development. The aim of this review is to present the most used AI methods for radiomics analysis, explaining the advantages and limitations of the methods. Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption. Importantly, this review will aim to highlight how AI can assist radiomics in overcoming major bottlenecks in clinical implementation, ultimately improving the translation potential of the method."

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

However, analyzing and processing this information could cause revealing and disclosing some sensitive and personal information when the information is contained in applications that are correlated to users such as location-based services, but concerns are diminished if the applications are correlated to general information such as scientific results. In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data."

Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem."

The accuracy of artificial intelligence depends on the amount of learning data and the appropriate algorithm. However, it is not easy to obtain learning data with a large number of entity. Less data set have large generalization errors due to overfitting. In order to minimize this generalization error, this study proposed DGA which can expect relatively high accuracy even though data with a less data set is applied to machine learning based genetic algorithm to deep learning based dropout. The idea of this paper is to determine the active state of the nodes. Using Gradient about loss function, A new fitness function is defined. Proposed Algorithm DGA is supplementing stochastic inconsistency about Dropout. Also DGA solved problem by the complexity of the fitness function and expression range of the model about Genetic Algorithm As a result of experiments using MNIST data proposed algorithm accuracy is 75.3%. Using only Dropout algorithm accuracy is 41.4%. It is shown that DGA is better than using only dropout."
