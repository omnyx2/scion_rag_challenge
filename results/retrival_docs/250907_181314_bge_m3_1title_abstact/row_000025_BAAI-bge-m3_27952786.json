The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods."

It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

Studies implementing deep learning in the dental field were searched, identified, and extracted from the electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus). Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice."

          "text": "Application of Deep Learning in Dentistry and Implantology Artificial intelligence and deep learning algorithms are infiltrating various fields of medicine and dentistry. The purpose of the current study was to review literatures applying deep learning algorithms to the dentistry and implantology. Electronic literature search through MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore library database was performed at 2019 October by combining free-text terms and entry terms associated with ‘dentistry’ and ‘deep learning’. The searched literature was screened by title/abstract level and full text level. Following data were extracted from the included studies: information of author, publication year, the aim of the study, architecture of deep learning, input data, output data, and performance of the deep learning algorithm in the study. 340 studies were retrieved from the databases and 62 studies were included in the study. Deep learning algorithms were applied to tooth localization and numbering, detection of dental caries/periodontal disease/periapical disease/oral cancerous lesion, localization of cephalometric landmarks, image quality enhancement, prediction and compensation of deformation error in additive manufacturing of prosthesis. Convolutional neural network was used for periapical radiograph, panoramic radiograph, or computed tomography in most of included studies. Deep learning algorithms are expected to help clinicians diagnose and make decisions by extracting dental data, detecting diseases and abnormal lesions, and improving image quality."

First, we review relevant pharmacogenomics studies that leverage numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to determine treatment prediction and potential biomarkers for antidepressant treatments in MDD. In addition, we depict some neuroimaging pharmacogenomics studies that utilize various machine learning approaches to predict antidepressant treatment outcomes in MDD based on the integration of research on pharmacogenomics and neuroimaging. Moreover, we summarize the limitations in regard to the past pharmacogenomics studies of antidepressant treatments in MDD. Finally, we outline a discussion of challenges and directions for future research. In light of latest advancements in neuroimaging and multi-omics, various genomic variants and biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatments in MDD are being identified in pharmacogenomics research by employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms."

          "text": "A Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges."

          "text": "Dance Movement Recognition based on Deep Learning In recent years with continuous development of the computer vision field, there has been an increasing demand for fast and accurate recognition of human movement, especially in sports. This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."
