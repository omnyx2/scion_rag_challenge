It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

          "text": "Digital Skills, Transmedia, and Artificial Intelligence Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history. In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies. The paper also looks at content, its delivery, data and metadata, and the implications for a better world built on the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) for 2030 enacted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN)."

The technical improvements of machine learning and deep learning, though, have been continuing and many breakthroughs have occurred recently. This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J. [1996] Mind and World (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), imaginative understanding (Campbell, J.

By looking at existing AI futures work, this paper surveys, and offers an initial categorisation of, several of the tools available for such futures-exploration, in particular those available to humanities scholars, and discusses some of the benefits and limitations of each. While no tools exist to reliably predict the future of artificial intelligence, several tools can help us expand our range of possible futures in order to reduce unexpected surprises, and to create common languages and models that enable constructive conversations about the kinds of futures we would like to occupy or avoid. The paper points at several tools as particularly promising and currently neglected, calling for more work in data-driven, realistic, integrative, and participatory scenario role-plays."

          "text": "Human- versus Artificial Intelligence AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously. For this purpose a first framework for educational content is proposed."

The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment. The presentation will conclude with a set of requirements and a summary of recommendations for future priorities."

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence."

Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."

This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J. [1996] Mind and World (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), imaginative understanding (Campbell, J.

          "text": "The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly."

          "text": "Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time."

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling."
