          "text": "Artificial Intelligence for Artificial Artificial Intelligence Crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk have become popular for a wide variety of human intelligence tasks; however, quality control continues to be a significant challenge. Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money."

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods."

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

          "text": "A Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges."

          "text": "Optimized Data Processing Analysis Using Big Data Cloud Platform Recently data processing has main gained many attention both from academic and commercial industry. Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems."

          "text": "Deep Contour Recovery: Repairing Breaks in Detected Contours using Deep Learning We present a contour recovery framework based on a deep learning model to connect broken contours (breaks) produced by contour detection methods. The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods."

          "text": "Wave data prediction with optimized machine learning and deep learning techniques Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships are in the development stage and they play an important role in the upcoming future. Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

          "text": "Information retrieval and artificial intelligence AbstractThis paper addresses the relations between information retrieval (IR) and AI. It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

          "text": "Topology optimization via machine learning and deep learning: a review Topology optimization (TO) is a method of deriving an optimal design that satisfies a given load and boundary conditions within a design domain. This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined."

Big Data is an enabler, as large and high-quality data are always the basis for successful machine learning algorithms and models. There is currently no fully established standard process for the machine learning life cycle, as is the case in data mining with the CRISP-DM-Process, which means that the operationalization of machine learning models in particular can present companies with major challenges. In this article, the implications for data management in companies are worked out on the basis of the view of the nature of the data, the various roles in machine learning teams and the life cycle of machine learning models."
