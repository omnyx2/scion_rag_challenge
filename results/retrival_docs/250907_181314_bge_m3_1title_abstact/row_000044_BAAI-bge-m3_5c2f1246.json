          "text": "Enhancing Smart Grid Anomaly Detection Through Deep Learning The modernization of power grids into smart grids introduces numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact."

This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."

          "text": "Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

          "text": "Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."

Following the initiatives of open data, many organizations including municipal governments are willing to share their data such as open big data regarding parking violations. While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected. Hence, in this article, we present a model for supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data. This temporally hierarchical privacy-preserving model (THPPM) adapts and extends the traditional temporal hierarchy to generalize spatial data generated within a time interval with an aim to preserve privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations during some time intervals at certain geographic locations. Evaluation on open big data from two North American cities demonstrates the usefulness of our model in supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data."

Over the past decade, AI has proven its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Various aspects of clinical practice in neuroimaging can be improved with the help of AI. For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images. In addition, image quality can be improved via AI-based image reconstruction or motion artifact reduction. In this review, we summarize recent clinical applications of DL in various aspects of neuroimaging."

Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."

          "text": "Dance Movement Recognition based on Deep Learning In recent years with continuous development of the computer vision field, there has been an increasing demand for fast and accurate recognition of human movement, especially in sports. This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."

Over the past decade, AI has proven its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Various aspects of clinical practice in neuroimaging can be improved with the help of AI. For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images. In addition, image quality can be improved via AI-based image reconstruction or motion artifact reduction. In this review, we summarize recent clinical applications of DL in various aspects of neuroimaging."

          "text": "Information retrieval and artificial intelligence AbstractThis paper addresses the relations between information retrieval (IR) and AI. It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

          "text": "Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."
