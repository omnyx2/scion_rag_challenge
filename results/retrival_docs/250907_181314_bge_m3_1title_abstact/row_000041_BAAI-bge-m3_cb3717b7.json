Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling."

Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."

          "text": "Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores."

          "text": "Topology optimization via machine learning and deep learning: a review Topology optimization (TO) is a method of deriving an optimal design that satisfies a given load and boundary conditions within a design domain. This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined."

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."

The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges."
