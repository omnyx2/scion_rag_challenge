          "text": "Technological Convergence of IT and BT: Evidence from Patent Analysis In recent innovation trends, one notable feature is the merging and overlapping of technologies: in other words, technological convergence. A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

Against this background, it is urgent to establish policy measures to survive and spread export products in the global industries.Research, design, data and methodology - In order to achieve this goal, we conducted the Importance - Performance Analysis (IPA) and found that it is necessary to develop tailor - made marketing support for small and medium sized IT exporters and to develop export strategy products with competitive technologies.Results - Above all, customized marketing support for IT export-related SMEs was needed. Next, in the first quadrant, strategic products, qualitative level, global, value added, and information systems were included, and it was found that 'development of export strategic products with competitive technologies' was necessary. In the third quadrant, related variables calculated at present time are not urgent variables.Conclusions - In this study, it would be necessary to calculate the additional implications of the variables that are not considered in this study, including future studies, because the methods considered here as analysis variables are carried out in comparison with the previous studies."

          "text": "A Comparative Study on Convergence of IT, BT and NT: Focusing on Patent Data Technological convergence is yielding new values and affecting various fields not by single technology but by convergence between technologies. This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area. NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."
