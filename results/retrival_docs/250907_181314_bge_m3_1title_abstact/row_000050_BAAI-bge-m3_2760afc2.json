Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact."

          "text": "Machine learning in oncology-Perspectives in patient-reported outcome research AbstractBackgroundIncreasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."

          "text": "Speech Recognition using Machine Learning Speech recognition is one of the fastest-growing engineering technologies. It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation. This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition."

          "text": "USING MACHINE LEARNING METHODS IN CYBERSECURITY Abstract Cybersecurity is an ever-changing field, with advances in technology that open up new opportunities for cyberattacks. In addition, even though serious secu- rity breaches are often reported, small organizations still have to worry about security breaches as they can often be the target of viruses and phishing. This is why it is so important to ensure the privacy of your user profile in cyberspace. The past few years have seen a rise in machine learning algorithms that address major cybersecu- rity issues such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), detection of new modifications of known malware, malware, and spam detection, and malware analysis. In this arti- cle, algorithms have been analyzed using data mining collected from various libraries, and analytics with additional emerging data-driven models to provide more effective security solutions. In addition, an analysis was carried out of companies that are en- gaged in cyber attacks using machine learning. According to the research results, it was revealed that the concept of cybersecurity data science allows you to make the computing process more efficient and intelligent compared to traditional processes in the field of cybersecurity. As a result, according to the results of the study, it was revealed that machine learning, namely unsupervised learning, is an effective method of dealing with risks in cybersecurity and cyberattacks."

          "text": "Design a personalized recommendation system using deep learning and reinforcement learning As the E-commerce market grows, the importance of personalized recommendation systems is increasing. Existing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods have shown a certain level of performance, but they have limitations such as cold start, data sparseness, and lack of long-term pattern learning. In this study, we design a matching system that combines a hybrid recommendation system and hyper-personalization technology and propose an efficient recommendation system. The core of the study is to develop a recommendation model that can improve recommendation accuracy and increase user satisfaction compared to existing systems. The proposed elements are as follows. First, the hybrid-hyper-personalization matching system provides recommendation accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, we propose an optimal product matching model that reflects user context using real-time data. Third, we optimize Personalized Recommendation System using deep learning and reinforcement learning. Fourth, we present a method to objectively evaluate recommendation performance through A/B testing."
