These tools can improve our clinical research capabilities and clinical decision making in the future. The present study reviews the foundations of BDA and ML, and explores possible applications in our field from a clinical viewpoint. We also suggest potential strategies to optimize these new technologies and describe a new kind of hybrid healthcare-data science professional with a linking role between clinicians and data."

          "text": "Wine Quality Evaluation Using Machine Learning Algorithms There are many prediction systems available for problems like stock exchange, medical diagnosis, insurance calculation, etc. Wine Quality is one area where there is a big opportunity to recommend a good quality of wine to users based on their preferences as well as in historical data. This paper describes the work to learn and assess whether a given wine sample is of good quality or not. The use of machine learning techniques specifically the linear regression with stochastic gradient descent were explored, and the features that perform well on this classification were engineered. The main aim is to develop a cost-effective system to acquire knowledge using data analysis through machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine in a better way."

          "text": "Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

Understanding these basic concepts is becoming increasingly important as kids don't have the opportunity to explore AI processes and improve their understanding of basic machine learning concepts and their essential components. Machine learning educational tools can help children easily understand artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this paper, we examine machine learning education tools and compare their features."
