Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."

For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization.

It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps.

Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially.

To fulfill the potential of energy big data and obtain insights to achieve smart energy management, we present a comprehensive study of big data driven smart energy management. We first discuss the sources and characteristics of energy big data. Also, a process model of big data driven smart energy management is proposed. Then taking smart grid as the research background, we provide a systematic review of big data analytics for smart energy management. It is discussed from four major aspects, namely power generation side management, microgrid and renewable energy management, asset management and collaborative operation, as well as demand side management (DSM). Afterwards, the industrial development of big data-driven smart energy management is analyzed and discussed. Finally, we point out the challenges of big data-driven smart energy management in IT infrastructure, data collection and governance, data integration and sharing, processing and analysis, security and privacy, and professionals."

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

The platform, called BBData - Big Building Data, is currently in production at the Smart Living Lab of Fribourg and is offered to several research teams to ease their work, to foster the sharing of historical data and to avoid that each project develops its own data gathering and processing pipeline."

          "text": "Machine learning on Big Data Statistical Machine Learning has undergone a phase transition from a pure academic endeavor to being one of the main drivers of modern commerce and science. Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

          "text": "Exploring Big Data Governance Frameworks Abstract The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."

Thus, analysis has continued for a long time in the quantity and quality of data, and there are changes in the location of data in the social sciences, past trends and the emergence of big data. The introduction of big data is presented as a prototype of new social science and is a useful practical example that empirically shows the need, basis, and direction of analysis through trend prediction services. Big data provides a future perspective as an important foundation for social change within the framework of basic social sciences."

          "text": "Nursing Needs Big Data and Big Data Needs Nursing AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient."

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

          "text": "Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review AbstractValue Chain has been considered as a key model for managing efficiently value creation processes within organizations. However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities."
