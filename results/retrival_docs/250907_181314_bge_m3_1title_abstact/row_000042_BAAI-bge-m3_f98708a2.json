Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given."

But in practice no model is ever entirely phenomenological or entirely mechanistic. We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient. These domain-specific requirements suggest a need for targeted funding, in which big data technologies for in silico medicine becomes the research priority."

          "text": "Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems."

However, analyzing and processing this information could cause revealing and disclosing some sensitive and personal information when the information is contained in applications that are correlated to users such as location-based services, but concerns are diminished if the applications are correlated to general information such as scientific results. In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data."

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."

          "text": "Exploring Big Data Governance Frameworks Abstract The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."
