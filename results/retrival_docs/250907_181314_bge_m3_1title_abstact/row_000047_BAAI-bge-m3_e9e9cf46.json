Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."

The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

In particular, various algorithms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, are continuously being improved. Among these algorithms, the expansion of deep learning is rapidly changing. Nevertheless, machine learning algorithms have not yet been applied in several fields, such as personal authentication technology. This technology is an essential tool in the digital information era, walking recognition technology as promising biometrics, and technology for solving state-space problems. Therefore, algorithm technologies of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, which are typical machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as agricultural technology, personal authentication, wireless network, game, biometric recognition, and image recognition, are being improved and expanded in this paper."

          "text": "Dance Movement Recognition based on Deep Learning In recent years with continuous development of the computer vision field, there has been an increasing demand for fast and accurate recognition of human movement, especially in sports. This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."

Auch wenn sie durch verschiedene algorithmische Fortschritte begleitet wird, ist diese Technik vor allem aus Anwendungssicht &#x201e;disruptiv“: Sie verschiebt die Grenze automatisierbarer Aufgaben betr&auml;chtlich, ver&auml;ndert die Art der Produktentwicklung und steht praktisch jedermann zur Verf&uuml;gung. Gegenstand des Deep Learning sind neuronale Netze mit einer großen Anzahl von Schichten. Verglichen mit fr&uuml;heren Ans&auml;tzen mit idealerweise einer einzigen Schicht, erlaubt dies den Einsatz massiver Rechenhardware, um Black-Box-Modelle mit einem Minimum an Entwicklungsaufwand direkt aus Rohdaten zu trainieren. Die meisten erfolgreichen Anwendungen finden sich in der Auswertung visueller Bilder, aber auch in der Audio- und Text-Modellierung."
