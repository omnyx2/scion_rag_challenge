For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images.

Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem."

Studies implementing deep learning in the dental field were searched, identified, and extracted from the electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus). Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice."

The purpose of the current study was to review literatures applying deep learning algorithms to the dentistry and implantology. Electronic literature search through MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore library database was performed at 2019 October by combining free-text terms and entry terms associated with ‘dentistry’ and ‘deep learning’. The searched literature was screened by title/abstract level and full text level. Following data were extracted from the included studies: information of author, publication year, the aim of the study, architecture of deep learning, input data, output data, and performance of the deep learning algorithm in the study. 340 studies were retrieved from the databases and 62 studies were included in the study. Deep learning algorithms were applied to tooth localization and numbering, detection of dental caries/periodontal disease/periapical disease/oral cancerous lesion, localization of cephalometric landmarks, image quality enhancement, prediction and compensation of deformation error in additive manufacturing of prosthesis. Convolutional neural network was used for periapical radiograph, panoramic radiograph, or computed tomography in most of included studies. Deep learning algorithms are expected to help clinicians diagnose and make decisions by extracting dental data, detecting diseases and abnormal lesions, and improving image quality."
