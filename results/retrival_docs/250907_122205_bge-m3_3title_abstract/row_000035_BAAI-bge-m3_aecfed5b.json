Against this background, it is urgent to establish policy measures to survive and spread export products in the global industries.Research, design, data and methodology - In order to achieve this goal, we conducted the Importance - Performance Analysis (IPA) and found that it is necessary to develop tailor - made marketing support for small and medium sized IT exporters and to develop export strategy products with competitive technologies.Results - Above all, customized marketing support for IT export-related SMEs was needed. Next, in the first quadrant, strategic products, qualitative level, global, value added, and information systems were included, and it was found that 'development of export strategic products with competitive technologies' was necessary.

This study investigated IT firms' concern about the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems and the role of IT firms in the process with Focus Group Interview and in-depth interview on executives of IT firms, and classified the concern to three major issues. They are the clarification of IT firms' role in the defense IT-convergent efforts, the establishment of the control tower for defense IT convergence, and reasonable estimation of software development cost in the defense acquisition process."

Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and has been implementing it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. This research analyzes various IT convergence issues based on an operation of defense IT convergence center, one of the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence issues are as follows : the methods for introducing rapid changing IT to military area, rapid deployment procedures of verified commercial technologies and products, regulations for using of domestic software promotion and so on. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and propose the framework and processes for applying IT to our defense sector as one of industries. Also, we establish various business models in the military perspective using defense IT convergence framework. In this paper, we focus the development of defense IT convergence through the alignment of national IT convergence policy and propose various business models established through operating a defense IT convergence center."

This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area. NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT.
