The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored.

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."

Existing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods have shown a certain level of performance, but they have limitations such as cold start, data sparseness, and lack of long-term pattern learning. In this study, we design a matching system that combines a hybrid recommendation system and hyper-personalization technology and propose an efficient recommendation system. The core of the study is to develop a recommendation model that can improve recommendation accuracy and increase user satisfaction compared to existing systems. The proposed elements are as follows. First, the hybrid-hyper-personalization matching system provides recommendation accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, we propose an optimal product matching model that reflects user context using real-time data. Third, we optimize Personalized Recommendation System using deep learning and reinforcement learning. Fourth, we present a method to objectively evaluate recommendation performance through A/B testing."

Following the initiatives of open data, many organizations including municipal governments are willing to share their data such as open big data regarding parking violations. While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected. Hence, in this article, we present a model for supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data. This temporally hierarchical privacy-preserving model (THPPM) adapts and extends the traditional temporal hierarchy to generalize spatial data generated within a time interval with an aim to preserve privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations during some time intervals at certain geographic locations. Evaluation on open big data from two North American cities demonstrates the usefulness of our model in supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data."
