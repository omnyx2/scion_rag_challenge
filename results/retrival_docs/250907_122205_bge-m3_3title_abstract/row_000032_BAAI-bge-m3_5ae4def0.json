A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and has been implementing it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. This research analyzes various IT convergence issues based on an operation of defense IT convergence center, one of the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence issues are as follows : the methods for introducing rapid changing IT to military area, rapid deployment procedures of verified commercial technologies and products, regulations for using of domestic software promotion and so on. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and propose the framework and processes for applying IT to our defense sector as one of industries. Also, we establish various business models in the military perspective using defense IT convergence framework. In this paper, we focus the development of defense IT convergence through the alignment of national IT convergence policy and propose various business models established through operating a defense IT convergence center."
