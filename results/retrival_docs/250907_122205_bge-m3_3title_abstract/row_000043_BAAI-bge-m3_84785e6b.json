Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

Auch wenn sie durch verschiedene algorithmische Fortschritte begleitet wird, ist diese Technik vor allem aus Anwendungssicht &#x201e;disruptivâ€œ: Sie verschiebt die Grenze automatisierbarer Aufgaben betr&auml;chtlich, ver&auml;ndert die Art der Produktentwicklung und steht praktisch jedermann zur Verf&uuml;gung. Gegenstand des Deep Learning sind neuronale Netze mit einer groÃŸen Anzahl von Schichten. Verglichen mit fr&uuml;heren Ans&auml;tzen mit idealerweise einer einzigen Schicht, erlaubt dies den Einsatz massiver Rechenhardware, um Black-Box-Modelle mit einem Minimum an Entwicklungsaufwand direkt aus Rohdaten zu trainieren. Die meisten erfolgreichen Anwendungen finden sich in der Auswertung visueller Bilder, aber auch in der Audio- und Text-Modellierung."
