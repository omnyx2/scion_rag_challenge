This research analyzes various IT convergence issues based on an operation of defense IT convergence center, one of the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence issues are as follows : the methods for introducing rapid changing IT to military area, rapid deployment procedures of verified commercial technologies and products, regulations for using of domestic software promotion and so on. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and propose the framework and processes for applying IT to our defense sector as one of industries. Also, we establish various business models in the military perspective using defense IT convergence framework. In this paper, we focus the development of defense IT convergence through the alignment of national IT convergence policy and propose various business models established through operating a defense IT convergence center."

Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and have been applying it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. Recently, the creative vitamin project has been launched. Vitamin 'D' means the way to create the value of defense industry. This research analyzes and evaluates various IT convergence business models based on an operation of defense IT convergence center from 2011 to 2014, which is the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence business models can be classified into four types of mission area as follows : weapon acquisition and management, military intelligence, military power construction, and resources management. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and describe the framework and processes for applying IT to the defense sector. We analyzes and evaluates various business models designed through defense IT convergence framework and processes."

This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area. NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources.
