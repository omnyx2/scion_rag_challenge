          "text": "A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety."

Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both."

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

[1972] What Computers Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Dreyfus, H. [1992] What Computers Still Can&rsquo;t Do (MIT Press, New York); Searle, J. [1980] Minds, brains and programs, Behav.

[2002] The Mind Doesn&rsquo;t Work that Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).). The technical improvements of machine learning and deep learning, though, have been continuing and many breakthroughs have occurred recently. This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J. [1996] Mind and World (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), imaginative understanding (Campbell, J. [2020] Causation in Psychology (Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA)), and animal knowledge (Sosa, E. [2007] A Virtue Epistemology: Apt Belief and Reflective Knowledge, volume 1 (Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK); Sosa, E. [2015] Judgment and Agency (Oxford University Press, Cambridge, MA)). Moreover, I will explore whether and in what way neuroscience-inspired AI and predictive coding (Hassabis, D., Kumaran, D., Summerfield, C., &amp; Botvinick, M. [2017] Neuroscience-inspired artificial intelligence, Neuron95(2), 245-258) can help carry out this project."

The purpose of the current study was to review literatures applying deep learning algorithms to the dentistry and implantology. Electronic literature search through MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore library database was performed at 2019 October by combining free-text terms and entry terms associated with ‘dentistry’ and ‘deep learning’. The searched literature was screened by title/abstract level and full text level. Following data were extracted from the included studies: information of author, publication year, the aim of the study, architecture of deep learning, input data, output data, and performance of the deep learning algorithm in the study. 340 studies were retrieved from the databases and 62 studies were included in the study. Deep learning algorithms were applied to tooth localization and numbering, detection of dental caries/periodontal disease/periapical disease/oral cancerous lesion, localization of cephalometric landmarks, image quality enhancement, prediction and compensation of deformation error in additive manufacturing of prosthesis. Convolutional neural network was used for periapical radiograph, panoramic radiograph, or computed tomography in most of included studies. Deep learning algorithms are expected to help clinicians diagnose and make decisions by extracting dental data, detecting diseases and abnormal lesions, and improving image quality."
