          "text": "Abstract The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."

The effects of IT convergence-contents were analyzed on the occupational performance of the elderly. This investigation was done with 100 elderly people above 65 years of age who lived in local community and two senior welfare centers in Busan and Kyeongbuk. The 100 elderly people were split into two groups of 50: the one group who has experience with IT convergence-contents was the experiment group, and the other group with no experience was the control group. In both groups, body functions, cognitive functions, activities of daily living and community participation were tested. The experimental group had higher scores for cognitive function, and activities of daily living than that of the control group. In conclusion, future studies can support continued IT convergence-contents at the local business community level rather than with smaller samples. This work lays the groundwork for follow-up studies to evaluate the effectiveness of IT convergence-contents."

More so, artificial intelligence is gaining wide adoption as it aims to enhance the learning outcomes of students. The purpose of the current research paper was to find out the best artificial intelligence tools for undergraduate students that may be used to enhance their learning results and also discover what students use AI tools for. Method: The purpose was achieved by adopting a survey design to collect data that was analyzed statistically using percentages and pie charts. Findings: The study found out that undergraduate students use ChatGPT, Grammarly, Meta AI, ELSA Speak, Notion AI, BlackBox, Tome.APP, Tabnine, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, AI Notes, Phatomath, Midjourney, StarryAI, Murf, Runway, Copy.AI, Durable or Soundful in their learning process. Such AI tools help them gain a better understanding of the topics related to their study, do assignments, create content faster, write a certain piece of content, get feedback on a given content, and do its translation. The AI tools also organize tasks, review answers, and instruct how to go about answering given tasks. Conclusion and Recommendation: The use of numerous AI tools by undergraduate students enhances learning. The upscaling of AI tool usage requires universities to focus their efforts on integrating AI into their curricula and offering regular training sessions, and workshops. They should also foster continuous research and development in AI and continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI tools and their impact on the performances of students."

However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

          "text": "Information technology convergence has been recognized one of the key drivers in the industry perspective. Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and has been implementing it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. This research analyzes various IT convergence issues based on an operation of defense IT convergence center, one of the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence issues are as follows : the methods for introducing rapid changing IT to military area, rapid deployment procedures of verified commercial technologies and products, regulations for using of domestic software promotion and so on. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and propose the framework and processes for applying IT to our defense sector as one of industries. Also, we establish various business models in the military perspective using defense IT convergence framework. In this paper, we focus the development of defense IT convergence through the alignment of national IT convergence policy and propose various business models established through operating a defense IT convergence center."

Also, it accelerates to pioneer new markets and develop new technologies. This trend becomes one of the most important factors to explore new national growth engines in Korea. Thus, this research examines current trends of IT convergence in Korea. The strategic characteristics of IT convergence in overseas are briefly explained for comparing purpose. The governmental strategies or efforts regarding the IT convergence have been surveyed. Some example convergences of LG, Samsung, and POSCO as major IT industries in Korea have been introduced. It also identifies several buzz concepts in this field. The study aims to provide an insight about the activities that are happening in the field of IT convergence in Korea. Finally, the findings through the research have been summarized."

          "text": "Technological convergence is yielding new values and affecting various fields not by single technology but by convergence between technologies. This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area. NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."

IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다.
