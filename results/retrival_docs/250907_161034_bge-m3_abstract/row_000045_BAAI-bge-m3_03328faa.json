Studies implementing deep learning in the dental field were searched, identified, and extracted from the electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus). Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice."

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

          "text": "Abstract The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question."

          "text": "AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient."

But in practice no model is ever entirely phenomenological or entirely mechanistic. We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

In particular, various algorithms, such as deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, are continuously being improved. Among these algorithms, the expansion of deep learning is rapidly changing. Nevertheless, machine learning algorithms have not yet been applied in several fields, such as personal authentication technology. This technology is an essential tool in the digital information era, walking recognition technology as promising biometrics, and technology for solving state-space problems. Therefore, algorithm technologies of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, which are typical machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as agricultural technology, personal authentication, wireless network, game, biometric recognition, and image recognition, are being improved and expanded in this paper."

          "text": "The aim of this literature review is to investigate current application and diagnostic performance of AI in the dental field, address their limitations, and suggest possible future applications to AI in dentistry. Studies implementing deep learning in the dental field were searched, identified, and extracted from the electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus). Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice."

          "text": "The unlimited possibilities of machine learning have been shown in several successful reports and applications. However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."

          "text": "The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges."
