Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

First, we review relevant pharmacogenomics studies that leverage numerous machine learning and deep learning techniques to determine treatment prediction and potential biomarkers for antidepressant treatments in MDD. In addition, we depict some neuroimaging pharmacogenomics studies that utilize various machine learning approaches to predict antidepressant treatment outcomes in MDD based on the integration of research on pharmacogenomics and neuroimaging. Moreover, we summarize the limitations in regard to the past pharmacogenomics studies of antidepressant treatments in MDD. Finally, we outline a discussion of challenges and directions for future research. In light of latest advancements in neuroimaging and multi-omics, various genomic variants and biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatments in MDD are being identified in pharmacogenomics research by employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms."

The purpose of the current study was to review literatures applying deep learning algorithms to the dentistry and implantology. Electronic literature search through MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore library database was performed at 2019 October by combining free-text terms and entry terms associated with ‘dentistry’ and ‘deep learning’. The searched literature was screened by title/abstract level and full text level. Following data were extracted from the included studies: information of author, publication year, the aim of the study, architecture of deep learning, input data, output data, and performance of the deep learning algorithm in the study. 340 studies were retrieved from the databases and 62 studies were included in the study. Deep learning algorithms were applied to tooth localization and numbering, detection of dental caries/periodontal disease/periapical disease/oral cancerous lesion, localization of cephalometric landmarks, image quality enhancement, prediction and compensation of deformation error in additive manufacturing of prosthesis. Convolutional neural network was used for periapical radiograph, panoramic radiograph, or computed tomography in most of included studies. Deep learning algorithms are expected to help clinicians diagnose and make decisions by extracting dental data, detecting diseases and abnormal lesions, and improving image quality."

This paper describes the work to learn and assess whether a given wine sample is of good quality or not. The use of machine learning techniques specifically the linear regression with stochastic gradient descent were explored, and the features that perform well on this classification were engineered. The main aim is to develop a cost-effective system to acquire knowledge using data analysis through machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine in a better way."

          "text": "At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets."

          "text": "Statistical Machine Learning has undergone a phase transition from a pure academic endeavor to being one of the main drivers of modern commerce and science. Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

Understanding these basic concepts is becoming increasingly important as kids don't have the opportunity to explore AI processes and improve their understanding of basic machine learning concepts and their essential components. Machine learning educational tools can help children easily understand artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this paper, we examine machine learning education tools and compare their features."
