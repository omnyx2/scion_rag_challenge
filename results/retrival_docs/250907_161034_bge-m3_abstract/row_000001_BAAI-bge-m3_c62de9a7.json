It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."

The purpose of the current research paper was to find out the best artificial intelligence tools for undergraduate students that may be used to enhance their learning results and also discover what students use AI tools for. Method: The purpose was achieved by adopting a survey design to collect data that was analyzed statistically using percentages and pie charts. Findings: The study found out that undergraduate students use ChatGPT, Grammarly, Meta AI, ELSA Speak, Notion AI, BlackBox, Tome.APP, Tabnine, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, AI Notes, Phatomath, Midjourney, StarryAI, Murf, Runway, Copy.AI, Durable or Soundful in their learning process. Such AI tools help them gain a better understanding of the topics related to their study, do assignments, create content faster, write a certain piece of content, get feedback on a given content, and do its translation. The AI tools also organize tasks, review answers, and instruct how to go about answering given tasks. Conclusion and Recommendation: The use of numerous AI tools by undergraduate students enhances learning. The upscaling of AI tool usage requires universities to focus their efforts on integrating AI into their curricula and offering regular training sessions, and workshops. They should also foster continuous research and development in AI and continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI tools and their impact on the performances of students."

The purpose of the current study was to review literatures applying deep learning algorithms to the dentistry and implantology. Electronic literature search through MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore library database was performed at 2019 October by combining free-text terms and entry terms associated with ‘dentistry’ and ‘deep learning’. The searched literature was screened by title/abstract level and full text level. Following data were extracted from the included studies: information of author, publication year, the aim of the study, architecture of deep learning, input data, output data, and performance of the deep learning algorithm in the study. 340 studies were retrieved from the databases and 62 studies were included in the study. Deep learning algorithms were applied to tooth localization and numbering, detection of dental caries/periodontal disease/periapical disease/oral cancerous lesion, localization of cephalometric landmarks, image quality enhancement, prediction and compensation of deformation error in additive manufacturing of prosthesis. Convolutional neural network was used for periapical radiograph, panoramic radiograph, or computed tomography in most of included studies. Deep learning algorithms are expected to help clinicians diagnose and make decisions by extracting dental data, detecting diseases and abnormal lesions, and improving image quality."

The purpose of the current study was to review literatures applying deep learning algorithms to the dentistry and implantology. Electronic literature search through MEDLINE and IEEE Xplore library database was performed at 2019 October by combining free-text terms and entry terms associated with ‘dentistry’ and ‘deep learning’. The searched literature was screened by title/abstract level and full text level. Following data were extracted from the included studies: information of author, publication year, the aim of the study, architecture of deep learning, input data, output data, and performance of the deep learning algorithm in the study. 340 studies were retrieved from the databases and 62 studies were included in the study. Deep learning algorithms were applied to tooth localization and numbering, detection of dental caries/periodontal disease/periapical disease/oral cancerous lesion, localization of cephalometric landmarks, image quality enhancement, prediction and compensation of deformation error in additive manufacturing of prosthesis. Convolutional neural network was used for periapical radiograph, panoramic radiograph, or computed tomography in most of included studies. Deep learning algorithms are expected to help clinicians diagnose and make decisions by extracting dental data, detecting diseases and abnormal lesions, and improving image quality."

Understanding these basic concepts is becoming increasingly important as kids don't have the opportunity to explore AI processes and improve their understanding of basic machine learning concepts and their essential components. Machine learning educational tools can help children easily understand artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this paper, we examine machine learning education tools and compare their features."

What doesn't work as advertised? What isn't likely to work? What isn't affordable? This article holds a mirror up to the community, both to provide feedback and stimulate more self-assessment. The significant accomplishments and strengths of the field are highlighted. The research agenda, strategy, and heuristics are reviewed, and a change of course is recommended to improve the field's ability to produce reusable and interoperable components.(Author abstract)"

          "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice."

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object."
