This paper describes the work to learn and assess whether a given wine sample is of good quality or not. The use of machine learning techniques specifically the linear regression with stochastic gradient descent were explored, and the features that perform well on this classification were engineered. The main aim is to develop a cost-effective system to acquire knowledge using data analysis through machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine in a better way."

Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling."

But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact."

Marr의 “Vision”이 출간된 이후 생물학적 접근에 의한 비전 연구가 주목을 받기 시작하면서 인공신경망을 이용한 컴퓨터 비전 연구가 활발히 진행되었다. 이후 1998년 Yann LeCun 등이 Convolutional Neural Network의 구조를 제안하였고, 이것이 초기의 CNN 모델이다. 본격적으로 Deep Learning이라는 용어는 Geoffrey Hinton에 의해서 사용되었다. 2006년 Geoffrey Hinton은 기존 신경망의 문제점을 해결하기 위해 Unsupervised Learning을 적용하는 방법을 제안하였다. 또한 최근 GPU의 발전으로 기존의 학습 속도의 한계를 극복하였고, 각종 Social Network Service(SNS)가 활발해 짐에 따라 다양한 형태의 데이터를 활용할 수 있게 되었다. 본 연구은 딥 러닝 기술 중 컴퓨터 비전에서 대표적으로 사용하는 Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)를 적용하여 사람의 머리 포즈를 추정하고 얼굴 특징점을 정렬하는 방법을 구현한다. 머리 포즈를 추정하기 위해서 CNN 중 분류(Classification)기법을 사용하고 각 층(Layer)의 수를 3, 4, 5개의 비지도학습(Unsupervised Learning)과 2개의 지도학습( Supervised Learning)을 이용한 구성을 비교하여 실험한다. 또한 입력 데이터의 채널 및 데이터의 양과 입력 방법에 따른 결과를 비교, 분석한다. 얼굴 특징점을 정렬하기 위해서 계층구조(Hierarchical Structure)를 사용하고 각 특징의 상관관계를 포함하지 않는 패치(Patch)를 적용하는 방법을 구현한다. 머리 포즈 추정에 사용한 데이터베이스는 ICT-3DHP, Biwi, GI4E와 자체 제작한 DB로 총 36,000장의 데이터를 사용하여 학습 및 실험을 한다. 또한 얼굴 특징점 정렬에 사용한 데이터베이스는 AFLW 10,000장을 학습하고 5,000장을 테스트한다. 머리 포즈 추정 실험의 오류를 측정하는 방법으로 Mean Absolute Error(MAE)를 사용하여 비교하였으며, Roll, Pitch, Yaw의 MAE는 각각 0.78, 0.99, 1.40의 값을 얻었다. 또한 얼굴 특징점 정렬은 Mean Absolute Percent Error(MAPE)를 사용하여 오차를 계산하였다. 21개의 각각의 특징점 평균 오차 약 1.0으로 기존의 평균보다 뛰어난 성능을 보인다. 이는 기존의 POSIT으로 추정한 값과 달리 얼굴 특징점을 사용하지 않고 영상만을 보고 판단할 수 있는 컴퓨터 비전에서 궁극적 형태의 새로운 학습 모델을 제안한다."

          "text": "The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges."

This paper describes the work to learn and assess whether a given wine sample is of good quality or not. The use of machine learning techniques specifically the linear regression with stochastic gradient descent were explored, and the features that perform well on this classification were engineered. The main aim is to develop a cost-effective system to acquire knowledge using data analysis through machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine in a better way."

          "text": "This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment. The world is moving at a fast pace having the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all the major disciplines and the educational sector is also not untouched by its impact especially in an online learning environment. This paper attempts to elaborate on the benefits of ML and AI in E-Learning (EL) in general and explain how King Khalid University (KKU) EL Deanship is making the best of ML and AI in its practices. Also, researchers have focused on the future of ML and AI in any academic program. This research is descriptive in nature; results are based on qualitative analysis done through tools and techniques of EL applied in KKU as an example but the same modus operandi can be implemented by any institution in its EL platform. KKU is using Learning Management Services (LMS) for providing online learning practices and Blackboard (BB) for sharing online learning resources, therefore these tools are considered by the researchers for explaining the results of ML and AI."

          "text": "The modernization of power grids into smart grids introduces numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact."

          "text": "AbstractMicrobial processes operated under realistic conditions are difficult to describe by mechanistic models, thereby limiting their optimization and control. Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling."
