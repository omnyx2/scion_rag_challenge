          "text": "A USAF sponsored MITRE research team undertook four separate, domain-specific case studies about Big Data applications. Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another."

While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data."

Building on literature in environmental studies, cultural studies and Science and Technology Studies, the article draws attention to the physical presence of data, the material configuration of digital service, and the space occupied by data. It then explains how this material and situated character of data raises questions concerning the ethics of the increasingly fashionable Big Data discourses. It argues that attention should be paid to (1) the vocabulary currently used when discussing the governance of data initiatives; (2) the internal tension between current data initiatives and environmental policies; (3) issues of fair distribution. The article explains how taking into account these aspects would allow for a more responsible behaviour in the context of data storage and production."

Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data. This essay elaborates on the ways Big Data impacts on ethical conceptions."

For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time."

          "text": "AbstractThis paper addresses the relations between information retrieval (IR) and AI. It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

          "text": "This paper addresses a problem that has so far been neglected by scholars investigating the ethics of Big Data and policy makers: that is the ethical implications of Big Data initiatives&rsquo; environmental impact. Building on literature in environmental studies, cultural studies and Science and Technology Studies, the article draws attention to the physical presence of data, the material configuration of digital service, and the space occupied by data. It then explains how this material and situated character of data raises questions concerning the ethics of the increasingly fashionable Big Data discourses. It argues that attention should be paid to (1) the vocabulary currently used when discussing the governance of data initiatives; (2) the internal tension between current data initiatives and environmental policies; (3) issues of fair distribution. The article explains how taking into account these aspects would allow for a more responsible behaviour in the context of data storage and production."

          "text": "In recent innovation trends, one notable feature is the merging and overlapping of technologies: in other words, technological convergence. A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."
