A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

          "text": "Abstract The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."

          "text": "AbstractThis paper addresses the relations between information retrieval (IR) and AI. It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."

          "text": "Abstract The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."
