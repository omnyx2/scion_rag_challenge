A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."

It examines document retrieval, summarising its essential features and illustrating the state of its art by presenting one probabilistic model in detail, with some test results showing its value. The paper then analyses this model and related successful approaches, concentrating on and justifying their use of weak, redundant representation and reasoning. It goes on to other information management tasks and considers how the concepts and methods developed for retrieval may be applied to these, concluding by arguing that such ways of dealing with information may also have wider relevance to AI."

Existing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods have shown a certain level of performance, but they have limitations such as cold start, data sparseness, and lack of long-term pattern learning. In this study, we design a matching system that combines a hybrid recommendation system and hyper-personalization technology and propose an efficient recommendation system. The core of the study is to develop a recommendation model that can improve recommendation accuracy and increase user satisfaction compared to existing systems. The proposed elements are as follows. First, the hybrid-hyper-personalization matching system provides recommendation accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, we propose an optimal product matching model that reflects user context using real-time data. Third, we optimize Personalized Recommendation System using deep learning and reinforcement learning. Fourth, we present a method to objectively evaluate recommendation performance through A/B testing."

          "text": "Learning strategies are defined as behaviors and thoughts that a learner engages in during learning and that are intended to influence the learner's encoding process. Today, demands for teaching how to learn increase, because there is a lot of complex material which is delivered to students. But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'. In addition learning strategies are associated with learning motivation. Students with 'meaning orientation' who struggle for deep learning, are intrinsically motivated, whereas students with 'reproduction orientation' or 'achieving orientation' are extrinsically motivated. Therefore, to foster active learning and intrinsic motivation of students, it isn't enough to just teach how to learn. Changes of curriculum and assessment methods, that stimulate deep learning and curiosity of students are needed with educators and learners working cooperatively."

The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively).

          "text": "AbstractA significant set of epistemic and political transformations are taking place as states and societies begin to understand themselves and their problems through the paradigm of deep neural network algorithms. A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data."

          "text": "Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."

A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy."

Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling."

Following the initiatives of open data, many organizations including municipal governments are willing to share their data such as open big data regarding parking violations. While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected. Hence, in this article, we present a model for supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data. This temporally hierarchical privacy-preserving model (THPPM) adapts and extends the traditional temporal hierarchy to generalize spatial data generated within a time interval with an aim to preserve privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations during some time intervals at certain geographic locations. Evaluation on open big data from two North American cities demonstrates the usefulness of our model in supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data."

Using the requirements, we drew design factors for the platform of gamification for education of deep learning.

For the design, the learners could be able to keep up with their abilities and to endorse continued learning. We developed an executable prototype of gamification based on the design. The educators evaluated a learning sample that applied on the prototype and discussed that it was relevant, despite some technical kinks.

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."

Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."

To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption.

          "text": "AbstractMicrobial processes operated under realistic conditions are difficult to describe by mechanistic models, thereby limiting their optimization and control. Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling."

          "text": "Topology optimization (TO) is a method of deriving an optimal design that satisfies a given load and boundary conditions within a design domain. This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined."

This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

          "text": "Learning strategies are defined as behaviors and thoughts that a learner engages in during learning and that are intended to influence the learner's encoding process. Today, demands for teaching how to learn increase, because there is a lot of complex material which is delivered to students. But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'. In addition learning strategies are associated with learning motivation. Students with 'meaning orientation' who struggle for deep learning, are intrinsically motivated, whereas students with 'reproduction orientation' or 'achieving orientation' are extrinsically motivated. Therefore, to foster active learning and intrinsic motivation of students, it isn't enough to just teach how to learn. Changes of curriculum and assessment methods, that stimulate deep learning and curiosity of students are needed with educators and learners working cooperatively."

This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

Existing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods have shown a certain level of performance, but they have limitations such as cold start, data sparseness, and lack of long-term pattern learning. In this study, we design a matching system that combines a hybrid recommendation system and hyper-personalization technology and propose an efficient recommendation system. The core of the study is to develop a recommendation model that can improve recommendation accuracy and increase user satisfaction compared to existing systems. The proposed elements are as follows. First, the hybrid-hyper-personalization matching system provides recommendation accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, we propose an optimal product matching model that reflects user context using real-time data. Third, we optimize Personalized Recommendation System using deep learning and reinforcement learning. Fourth, we present a method to objectively evaluate recommendation performance through A/B testing."

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."

A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy."

          "text": "AbstractA significant set of epistemic and political transformations are taking place as states and societies begin to understand themselves and their problems through the paradigm of deep neural network algorithms. A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data."
