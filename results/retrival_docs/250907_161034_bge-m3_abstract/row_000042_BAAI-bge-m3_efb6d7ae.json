Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately.

This paper describes the work to learn and assess whether a given wine sample is of good quality or not. The use of machine learning techniques specifically the linear regression with stochastic gradient descent were explored, and the features that perform well on this classification were engineered. The main aim is to develop a cost-effective system to acquire knowledge using data analysis through machine learning algorithms to predict the quality of wine in a better way."

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

There is currently no fully established standard process for the machine learning life cycle, as is the case in data mining with the CRISP-DM-Process, which means that the operationalization of machine learning models in particular can present companies with major challenges. In this article, the implications for data management in companies are worked out on the basis of the view of the nature of the data, the various roles in machine learning teams and the life cycle of machine learning models."

Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems."

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

In this work, a survey has been done over security and privacy challenges and approaches in big data. The challenges included here are in each of the following areas: privacy, access control, encryption, and authentication in big data. Likewise, the approaches presented here are privacy-preserving approaches in big data, access control approaches in big data, encryption approaches in big data, and authentication approaches in big data."

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."

Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework."
