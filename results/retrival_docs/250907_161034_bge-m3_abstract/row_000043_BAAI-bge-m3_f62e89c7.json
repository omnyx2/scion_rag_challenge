Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

The world is moving at a fast pace having the application of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all the major disciplines and the educational sector is also not untouched by its impact especially in an online learning environment. This paper attempts to elaborate on the benefits of ML and AI in E-Learning (EL) in general and explain how King Khalid University (KKU) EL Deanship is making the best of ML and AI in its practices. Also, researchers have focused on the future of ML and AI in any academic program. This research is descriptive in nature; results are based on qualitative analysis done through tools and techniques of EL applied in KKU as an example but the same modus operandi can be implemented by any institution in its EL platform. KKU is using Learning Management Services (LMS) for providing online learning practices and Blackboard (BB) for sharing online learning resources, therefore these tools are considered by the researchers for explaining the results of ML and AI."

          "text": "Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history. In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies. The paper also looks at content, its delivery, data and metadata, and the implications for a better world built on the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) for 2030 enacted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN)."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

Therefore, algorithm technologies of deep learning, reinforcement learning, and Q-learning, which are typical machine learning algorithms in various fields, such as agricultural technology, personal authentication, wireless network, game, biometric recognition, and image recognition, are being improved and expanded in this paper."

          "text": "Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history. In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies. The paper also looks at content, its delivery, data and metadata, and the implications for a better world built on the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) for 2030 enacted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN)."

          "text": "Recently, artificial intelligence related technologies including machine learning are being applied to various fields, and the demand is also increasing. In particular, with the development of AR, VR, and MR technologies related to image processing, the utilization of computer vision based on deep learning has increased. The algorithms for object recognition and detection based on deep learning required for image processing are diversified and advanced. Accordingly, problems that were difficult to solve with the existing methodology were solved more simply and easily by using deep learning. This paper introduces various deep learning-based object recognition and extraction algorithms used to detect and recognize various objects in an image and analyzes the technologies that attract attention."

          "text": "Timely analysis of imaging data is critical for diagnosis and decision-making for proper treatment strategy in the cases of ischemic stroke. Various efforts have been made to develop computer-assisted systems to improve the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and acute stroke triage. The widespread emergence of artificial intelligence technology has been integrated into the field of medicine. Artificial intelligence can play an important role in providing care to patients with stroke. In the past few decades, numerous studies have explored the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for application in the management of stroke. In this review, we will start with a brief introduction to machine learning and deep learning and provide clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning in various aspects of stroke management, including rapid diagnosis and improved triage, identifying large vessel occlusion, predicting time from stroke onset, automated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) measurement, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcome. This work is focused on providing the current application of artificial intelligence techniques in the imaging of ischemic stroke, including MRI and CT."
