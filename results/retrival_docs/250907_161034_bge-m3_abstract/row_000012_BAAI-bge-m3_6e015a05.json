The aim of this review is to present the most used AI methods for radiomics analysis, explaining the advantages and limitations of the methods. Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption.

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."

          "text": "Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) now plays a critical role in almost every area of our daily lives and academic disciplines due to the growth of computing power, advances in methods and techniques, and the explosion of the amount of data; medicine is not an exception. Rather than replacing clinicians, AI is augmenting the intelligence of clinicians in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment decisions. Summary: Kidney disease is a substantial medical and public health burden globally, with both acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease bringing about high morbidity and mortality as well as a huge economic burden. Even though the existing research and applied works have made certain contributions to more accurate prediction and better understanding of histologic pathology, there is a lot more work to be done and problems to solve. Key Messages: AI applications of diagnostics and prognostics for high-prevalence and high-morbidity types of nephropathy in medical-resource-inadequate areas need special attention; high-volume and high-quality data need to be collected and prepared; a consensus on ethics and safety in the use of AI technologies needs to be built."

These tools can improve our clinical research capabilities and clinical decision making in the future. The present study reviews the foundations of BDA and ML, and explores possible applications in our field from a clinical viewpoint. We also suggest potential strategies to optimize these new technologies and describe a new kind of hybrid healthcare-data science professional with a linking role between clinicians and data."

          "text": "AbstractBackgroundIncreasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested."

Neural-net computing on the other hand seems to be better suited to meeting the demands of those types of tasks. These matters are discussed in this paper and it is suggested that the type of Artificial Intelligence appropriate for use in an engineering system will be an evolved one combining the strengths of symbolic processing and neural-net computing."
