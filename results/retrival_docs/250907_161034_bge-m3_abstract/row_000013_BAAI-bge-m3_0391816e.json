Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data."

          "text": "AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient."

          "text": "Abstract The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question."

          "text": "AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient."

With Normalization Process Theory in place, this study conducts socio-technical evaluation on the big data phenomenon to understand the developmental processes through which new practices of thinking and enacting are implemented, embedded, and integrated in South Korea. It also undertakes empirical analyses of user modeling to explore the factors influencing users' adoption of big data by integrating cognitive motivations as well as user values as the primary determining factors. Based on the qualitative and quantitative findings, this study concludes that big data should be developed with user-centered ideas and that users should be the focus of big data design.

But specifical and theoretical study about possible risk factors as introduction of big data is not being conducted. Accordingly, the study extracts the possible risk factors as introduction of big data based on literature reviews and classifies according to big data processing, data collection, data storage, data analysis, analysis data visualization and application. Also, the risk factors have order of priority according to the degree of risk from the survey of experts. This study will make a chance that can avoid risks by bid data processing and preparation for risks in order of dangerous grades of risk."
