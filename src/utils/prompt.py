Each puzzle consists of discovery a deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or transformation law that maps inputs to outputs.
Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors, but the order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

The middle schoolers are trying to discover this deterministic transformation, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`.
Designing a puzzle involves also creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example of what the transformation can be applied to.

Please design a single puzzle by writing code containing the `generate_input` and `main` functions. You can use the following standard library (`common.py`):

Each puzzle consists of uncovering a single deterministic rule, pattern, procedure, algorithm, or general transformation that maps inputs to output. Both the inputs and outputs are 2D grids of colored pixels. There are 10 colors. The order of the colors is never relevant to the puzzle.

Your job is to create a knock-off puzzle that has similar concepts and challenges to puzzles created by honest puzzle makers.

Puzzle-solvers will try to figure out the deterministic transformation in the knock-off puzzle you create, which can be implemented as a Python function called `main`. Designing a knock-off puzzle involves creating example inputs, which can be implemented as a Python function called `generate_input`. Unlike `main`, the `generate_input` function should be stochastic, so that every time you run it, you get another good example grid that the transformation can be applied to.
