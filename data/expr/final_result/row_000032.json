This study defines u-IT Convergence and proposes performance evaluation criteria and a standardization framework for these devices, particularly focusing on sensors that detect information such as temperature, pressure, magnetism, light, gas, and humidity.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe proposed performance evaluation criteria for u-IT Convergence devices include **technicality (기술성), economic feasibility (경제성), and management (경영성)**. These criteria are intended to provide a basis for assessing the devices.\n\nFollowing these evaluation criteria, the standardization framework involves researching **standardization criteria for u-IT Convergence network devices**. This indicates that the standardization efforts are directly linked to and guided by the established performance evaluation criteria for the devices themselves.\n\n##Conclusion##\nThis research aims to contribute to the establishment of value for u-IT Convergence products as certified items possessing stability and reliability through accurate certification evaluations, and to achieve standardization within the ubiquitous information society.",

In the technological change, a technical boundary of information technology (IT) and operation technology (OT) is being blurred by that new concepts such as interoperability. In addtion, IT/OT convergence has been proposed by the improvement of ICT and power system technology. At the viewpoint, advanced distribution management system (ADMS) to have the new concepts and to increase distribution system operation efficiency through global information and functions from the other systems has been proposed.In order to implement the ADMS, IT and OT have to be employed together on the ADMS; and the concept-based IT/OT convergence concept has been presented. Therefore, this paper introduces ADMS and IT/OT convergence and proposes a design of IT/OT convergence based ADMS system design with configurations and functions."
