Recent technological advancements have provided access to vast datasets, enabling sophisticated analyses that were previously unattainable. This integration promises to revolutionize clinical practice in neuroimaging, offering improved accuracy and efficiency. However, alongside these significant advancements, several critical challenges must be addressed to fully realize the potential of these technologies in healthcare.\n\n##Main Body##\n**Main Advances:**\nThe integration of AI, particularly deep learning (DL), and Big Data in neurological medical imaging has led to remarkable progress across several fronts:\n\n*   **Enhanced Image Recognition and Analysis:** AI, powered by deep learning, has demonstrated significant capabilities in image recognition tasks, proving its feasibility for various applications in medical imaging. This includes the ability to process and interpret large volumes of neuroimaging data more efficiently.\n*   **Improved Clinical Practice in Neuroimaging:** AI can enhance numerous aspects of clinical practice. Specific applications include:\n    *   **Detection and Diagnosis:** Aiding in the detection of brain metastases and improving the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and acute stroke triage.\n    *   **Treatment Prediction and Monitoring:** Predicting the treatment response of brain tumors and predicting treatment outcomes for conditions like ischemic stroke.\n    *   **Advanced Imaging Techniques:** Generating parametric maps from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images.\n    *   **Image Quality Improvement:** Improving image quality through AI-based image reconstruction and motion artifact reduction.\n*   **Stroke Management:** AI and machine learning algorithms have been extensively explored for their application in managing ischemic stroke, including:\n    *   Rapid diagnosis and improved triage.\n    *   Identifying large vessel occlusion.\n    *   Predicting the time from stroke onset.\n    *   Automated Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) measurement.\n    *   Lesion segmentation.\n*   **Access to Diverse Datasets:** Recent technological advances have facilitated access to a multitude of datasets pertaining to various dimensions in neurology, including Real-World Data (RWD) and analytics related to large volumes of information.\n\n**Main Challenges:**\nDespite the enormous opportunities, the application of AI and Big Data in neurological medical imaging faces several significant challenges:\n\n*   **Data Quality:** Ensuring the quality, consistency, and standardization of the vast datasets required for AI and Big Data applications remains a critical hurdle. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate models and unreliable clinical insights.\n*   **Ethics:** Ethical considerations are paramount, particularly concerning patient privacy, data security, and the responsible use of AI in clinical decision-making. The implications of AI-driven diagnoses and treatment recommendations require careful ethical oversight.\n*   **Intrinsic Difficulties in Healthcare Application:** There are inherent difficulties related to applying data science in healthcare settings. These can include the complexity of biological systems, the variability in patient populations, and the need for robust validation in real-world clinical environments.\n\n##Conclusion##\nThe application of artificial intelligence and Big Data to medical imaging in neurology presents a transformative potential, offering significant advances in diagnosis, treatment planning, and image quality enhancement. From detecting brain tumors and improving stroke management to refining image reconstruction, AI-powered deep learning is revolutionizing neuroimaging. However, realizing the full promise of these technologies necessitates overcoming substantial challenges related to data quality, ethical considerations, and the inherent complexities of integrating data science into healthcare. Addressing these challenges will be crucial for the continued and responsible advancement of AI and Big Data in neurological medicine.",

Various efforts have been made to develop computer-assisted systems to improve the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and acute stroke triage. The widespread emergence of artificial intelligence technology has been integrated into the field of medicine. Artificial intelligence can play an important role in providing care to patients with stroke. In the past few decades, numerous studies have explored the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for application in the management of stroke. In this review, we will start with a brief introduction to machine learning and deep learning and provide clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning in various aspects of stroke management, including rapid diagnosis and improved triage, identifying large vessel occlusion, predicting time from stroke onset, automated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) measurement, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcome. This work is focused on providing the current application of artificial intelligence techniques in the imaging of ischemic stroke, including MRI and CT."
