            "title": "Deep Learning for Radar Imaging: Enhancements, Challenges, and Proposed Architecture",
            "introduction": "Deep learning techniques are envisioned to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging, moving beyond their direct application in automatic target recognition (ATR) to a broader range of radar problems. This approach aims to leverage recent advancements in deep learning to improve various aspects of radar imaging.",
            "main_body": "Deep learning is expected to play a central role in enhancing radar imaging by addressing a wide range of problems. While its relevance in radar problems beyond ATR is not immediately obvious, the vision is that it can be applied to advance the state-of-the-art across many radar imaging challenges. The main challenges associated with applying these methods are discussed, although the specific challenges are not explicitly detailed beyond their existence. The proposed network architecture is designed based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem. This architecture augments learning with traditional SAR modeling, creating a framework that can capture the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, this process is demonstrated to be useful for learning and compensating for trajectory based phase error, which is crucial for the autofocus problem in radar imaging.",
            "conclusion": "In summary, deep learning is poised to enhance radar imaging by providing a framework that integrates learning with traditional SAR modeling to address complex problems like non-linearity and autofocus. While challenges exist in applying these methods, the proposed SAR-specific network architecture offers a path for significant advancements in the field."

Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem.</P>"
