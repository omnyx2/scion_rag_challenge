            "title": "Summary of Machine Learning Applications and Ethical Considerations in Maternal-Fetal Diagnosis",
            "introduction": "This summary outlines the primary applications of machine learning methods for the early diagnosis of maternal-fetal conditions and addresses the associated ethical considerations, drawing insights from recent advancements in artificial intelligence in obstetrics.",
            "main_body": "Machine learning methods have been successfully applied for the early diagnosis of various maternal-fetal conditions. These applications involve different kinds of data capture to identify conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth. The successful employment of these methods highlights their potential in improving early detection capabilities in obstetrics. Alongside the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence in this field, it is crucial to consider the ethical issues that arise.",
            "conclusion": "In conclusion, machine learning offers significant advancements for the early diagnosis of maternal-fetal conditions, including preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth, by leveraging diverse data capture techniques. However, the growing use of artificial intelligence necessitates a careful consideration of the ethical implications to ensure responsible implementation."
