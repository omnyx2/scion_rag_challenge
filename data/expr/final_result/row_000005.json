A key application highlighted in the context is the early diagnosis of conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth. These methods have demonstrated success in handling different types of data capture relevant to the early detection of these maternal-fetal conditions.\n\nAlongside the growing adoption and successful implementation of artificial intelligence, including machine learning, in this sensitive medical field, it is imperative that ethical issues are given due consideration. The context emphasizes that with the more popular use of artificial intelligence, ethical issues should be addressed accordingly.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn conclusion, machine learning methods are primarily applied for the early diagnosis of critical maternal-fetal conditions like preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth, utilizing various data capture techniques. However, the widespread integration of artificial intelligence in this domain necessitates a careful and ongoing consideration of the ethical implications.",

Especially, 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)' was used to compare the robot arm motion difference between before the maintenance(bearing change) and after the maintenance. 6-axies vibration sensor was used to detect the vibration sensing during the motion of the robot arm. The results of the comparison, MD value of the arm motions of the after the maintenance(bearing change) was much lower and stable compared to MD value of the arm motions of the before the maintenance.

Especially, 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)' was used to compare the robot arm motion difference between before the maintenance(bearing change) and after the maintenance. 6-axies vibration sensor was used to detect the vibration sensing during the motion of the robot arm. The results of the comparison, MD value of the arm motions of the after the maintenance(bearing change) was much lower and stable compared to MD value of the arm motions of the before the maintenance. MD value well distinguished the fine difference of the arm vibration of the robot. The superior performance of the MT method applied to the prediction of the robot trouble was verified by this experiments."
