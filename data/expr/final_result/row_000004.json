        "title": "Key Features of a Sustainability-Oriented Corporate Culture for Sustainable AI",
        "introduction": "The provided context examines the influence of corporate culture on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in terms of sustainable development, which is referred to as Sustainable Artificial Intelligence (SAI). It emphasizes that corporate culture is an important indicator and influencing factor for the realization of SAI.",
        "main_body": "Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, the document 'Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective' identifies features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. Furthermore, the paper offers six propositions that explore how specific manifestations of this culture influence the handling of AI to achieve SAI. However, the specific details of these identified features and the content of the six propositions are not explicitly enumerated or described within the provided abstract.",
        "conclusion": "While the context highlights that features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture are identified and their influence on SAI is examined through propositions, the actual key features themselves are not detailed in the provided information. The document underscores the critical role of corporate culture for companies aiming to ensure the realization of Sustainable Artificial Intelligence."

For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time.</P></P>"
