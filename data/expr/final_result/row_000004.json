To navigate these complexities and ensure the responsible deployment of AI, the concept of Sustainable Artificial Intelligence (SAI) has emerged. A critical factor in the realization and effective management of SAI is the underlying corporate culture, particularly one oriented towards sustainability.\n\n##Main Body##\nResearch indicates that corporate culture plays a pivotal role as both an important indicator and an influencing factor in the successful implementation of Sustainable Artificial Intelligence. A sustainability-oriented corporate culture is understood to influence how AI is handled in the context of sustainable development, incorporating a normative element into its use.\n\nWhile the provided context highlights that features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture have been identified through bibliometric literature analysis, and that six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI are offered, the specific details of these key features and propositions are not explicitly enumerated within the provided text. The context primarily establishes the significance of corporate culture in shaping the development and management of SAI, without detailing the individual characteristics of such a culture.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn conclusion, a sustainability-oriented corporate culture is recognized as an essential element for ensuring the realization and effective management of Sustainable Artificial Intelligence. This type of culture is understood to influence the use of AI in a manner that aligns with sustainable development principles. Although the context confirms that specific features of such a culture and their influence on SAI have been identified and proposed, the explicit list of these key features is not provided within the given information.",

Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment.

The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored.

This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment. The presentation will conclude with a set of requirements and a summary of recommendations for future priorities."

For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time."

By looking at existing AI futures work, this paper surveys, and offers an initial categorisation of, several of the tools available for such futures-exploration, in particular those available to humanities scholars, and discusses some of the benefits and limitations of each. While no tools exist to reliably predict the future of artificial intelligence, several tools can help us expand our range of possible futures in order to reduce unexpected surprises, and to create common languages and models that enable constructive conversations about the kinds of futures we would like to occupy or avoid. The paper points at several tools as particularly promising and currently neglected, calling for more work in data-driven, realistic, integrative, and participatory scenario role-plays."

Big Data is an enabler, as large and high-quality data are always the basis for successful machine learning algorithms and models. There is currently no fully established standard process for the machine learning life cycle, as is the case in data mining with the CRISP-DM-Process, which means that the operationalization of machine learning models in particular can present companies with major challenges. In this article, the implications for data management in companies are worked out on the basis of the view of the nature of the data, the various roles in machine learning teams and the life cycle of machine learning models."
