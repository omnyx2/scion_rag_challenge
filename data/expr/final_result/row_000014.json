While phenomenological knowledge is derived from analyzing large datasets, mechanistic models aim to provide detailed, patient-specific insights. However, the content suggests that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive and can be effectively combined through Big Data analytics.\n\n###Main Body###\nThe content describes the combination of phenomenological and mechanistic approaches by acknowledging that, in practice, no model is purely one or the other. It proposes that Big Data analytics can be successfully integrated with Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) technologies to create robust and effective \"in silico medicine\" solutions. This combination is crucial for personalized healthcare.\n\nTo achieve this, Big Data technologies must be further developed to meet specific requirements. These include:\n*   **Integration of diverse data**: Specialized analytics are needed to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information (representing mechanistic understanding) with clinical observations at various scales (tissue, organ, and organism), which often provide phenomenological data.\n*   **Defining the \"physiological envelope\"**: Big Data analytics can be used to define the unique \"physiological envelope\" for each patient during their daily life. This involves leveraging large amounts of observational data (phenomenological) to understand an individual's normal physiological range, which can then inform and be integrated with mechanistic models for personalized interventions.\n\nOther requirements for Big Data technologies to facilitate this combination include working with sensitive data, analyzing complex and heterogeneous data spaces (including nontextual information), and managing distributed data under security and performance constraints. The ultimate goal is to move towards a research priority where Big Data technologies for in silico medicine are specifically funded to enable this integrated approach.\n\n###Conclusion###\nIn conclusion, the content highlights that Big Data analytics serves as a critical bridge to combine phenomenological knowledge, extracted from vast datasets, with detailed mechanistic models for individual patients. This is achieved through specialized analytics that integrate multi-scale biological and clinical data and define personalized physiological parameters. This hybrid approach, facilitated by advanced Big Data technologies, is essential for developing robust \"in silico medicine\" solutions and advancing personalized healthcare.",

Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems."

Thus, analysis has continued for a long time in the quantity and quality of data, and there are changes in the location of data in the social sciences, past trends and the emergence of big data. The introduction of big data is presented as a prototype of new social science and is a useful practical example that empirically shows the need, basis, and direction of analysis through trend prediction services. Big data provides a future perspective as an important foundation for social change within the framework of basic social sciences."

These tools can improve our clinical research capabilities and clinical decision making in the future. The present study reviews the foundations of BDA and ML, and explores possible applications in our field from a clinical viewpoint. We also suggest potential strategies to optimize these new technologies and describe a new kind of hybrid healthcare-data science professional with a linking role between clinicians and data."

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable."
