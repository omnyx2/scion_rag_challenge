To achieve this ambitious goal, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network has proposed a generic enabling framework.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe proposed enabling framework for SDG2 is designed to connect diverse stakeholders across the entire food network, facilitating the necessary feedbacks and information flows for effective execution. This framework is universally applicable, regardless of a country's development status. A critical requirement for the success of this framework is the **availability and free exchange of data**. This data sharing is fundamental to fostering collaboration and ensuring that all relevant parties have access to the information needed for coordinated interventions.\n\nComplementing data sharing, **near real-time analytics** plays an indispensable role. By applying near real-time analytics to the freely exchanged data, the framework aims to generate essential knowledge flows. This capability allows for timely insights and adaptive decision-making, which are crucial for managing the complexities of the global food system and responding effectively to evolving challenges. The framework also envisions leveraging data-driven innovation, including the deployment of IoT and Big Data related technologies, as well as new sensor and networking technologies, to enhance its implementation in both developing and developed economies.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn essence, the enabling framework for SDG2 is a stakeholder-connecting platform that relies heavily on the seamless flow of information. Its success is predicated on the dual pillars of readily available and freely exchanged data, coupled with the power of near real-time analytics to transform this data into actionable knowledge, thereby driving effective and sustainable solutions for global food security.",

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data.\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    {\n      \"query\": \"What is the role of near real-time analytics within this framework?\",\n      \"query_meta\": {\n        \"type\": \"single_hop\",\n        \"index\": 2\n      },\n      \"top_k\": 10,\n      \"hits\": [\n        {\n          \"rank\": 1,\n          \"score\": 0.5682742595672607,\n          \"doc_id\": \"194\",\n          \"text\": \"Real-Time Monitoring of COVID-19 Vaccination Compliance: A Ubiquitous IT Convergence Approach Real-Time Monitoring of COVID-19 Vaccination Compliance: A Ubiquitous IT Convergence Approach Real-Time Monitoring of COVID-19 Vaccination Compliance: A Ubiquitous IT Convergence Approach As most countries relax restrictions on lockdown and social activities returns due to massive response to COVID-19 vaccination, there is need to put in place a universally acceptable technological innovation that can checkmate and enforce compliance to avoid resurgence of another deadly wave as witnessed previously. Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities.

To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI.

In this paper, we provide a framework for developing practical and reasonable data sharing policies that incorporate the sociological, financial, technical and scientific requirements of a sustainable Big Data dependent scientific community.FindingsMany biomedical and healthcare studies may be significantly impacted by using large, heterogeneous and incongruent datasets; however there are significant technical, social, regulatory, and institutional barriers that need to be overcome to ensure the power of Big Data overcomes these detrimental factors.ConclusionsPragmatic policies that demand extensive sharing of data, promotion of data fusion, provenance, interoperability and balance security and protection of personal information are critical for the long term impact of translational Big Data analytics."

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data."

Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities. This innovation guarantees intuitive monitoring of vaccination progress and curtailment of COVID-19 spread through compliance enforcement."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."
