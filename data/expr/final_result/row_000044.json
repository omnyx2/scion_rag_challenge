The provided context offers insights into the general application and structure of neural networks in speech recognition and machine learning.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe context highlights that Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provide a theoretical framework for artificial intelligence and consist of input, hidden, and output vectors connected by weight matrices (Doc 153). Neural machine translation, a key algorithm in the industry for machine translation, utilizes two recurrent neural networks in tandem to form an encoder-decoder structure (Doc 225). Deep learning, a sub-field of machine learning, is also described as dealing with algorithms inspired by artificial neural networks (Doc 179). These documents indicate that neural networks are widely used in speech recognition and related fields for tasks such as converting audio into text and translating between languages (Doc 225).\n\nHowever, the provided JSON data does not contain specific information regarding Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), their function in audiovisual speech recognition, or how they are integrated with neural networks. Furthermore, there is no explicit explanation within the given context about how such an integration would specifically enhance robustness in noisy environments for audiovisual speech recognition.\n\n##Conclusion##\nWhile the provided context details the role and architecture of neural networks in speech recognition and machine translation, it does not offer information on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), their integration with neural networks, or how this combined approach achieves robustness in noisy environments for audiovisual speech recognition. Therefore, based solely on the given context, it is not possible to answer the question regarding the integration of HMMs and NNs for robustness in noisy environments.",

Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given."
