These advanced computational methods provide a vital foundation for understanding the complex interplay of genetic and other biological factors influencing treatment response.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe essence of applying various machine and deep learning approaches to pharmacogenomics research for antidepressant treatment prediction lies in their ability to serve as a vital foundation for this field. These techniques are leveraged to achieve several key objectives:\n\n*   **Treatment Prediction:** They are used to determine the likelihood of a patient responding to specific antidepressant treatments.\n*   **Biomarker Identification:** Machine and deep learning algorithms help in identifying potential biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatment response. This includes uncovering various genomic variants and other biological indicators.\n*   **Data Integration:** These approaches facilitate the integration of diverse data types, such as neuroimaging and multi-omics data, with pharmacogenomic information. This comprehensive integration allows for a more holistic understanding of treatment outcomes.\n*   **Overcoming Limitations:** By employing these algorithms, researchers aim to address the limitations of past pharmacogenomics studies, paving the way for more accurate predictions and personalized treatment strategies.\n\nUltimately, machine and deep learning enable the identification of genomic variants and biomarkers linked to antidepressant treatments in MDD, thereby advancing the field of pharmacogenomics.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn conclusion, the core essence of integrating machine and deep learning into pharmacogenomics research for antidepressant treatment prediction is to establish a robust framework for accurately predicting treatment response and identifying critical biomarkers. By effectively analyzing and integrating complex multi-omics and neuroimaging data, these computational methods are instrumental in moving towards more personalized and effective antidepressant therapies for individuals suffering from major depressive disorder.",

This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm.

Moreover, we summarize the limitations in regard to the past pharmacogenomics studies of antidepressant treatments in MDD. Finally, we outline a discussion of challenges and directions for future research. In light of latest advancements in neuroimaging and multi-omics, various genomic variants and biomarkers associated with antidepressant treatments in MDD are being identified in pharmacogenomics research by employing machine learning and deep learning algorithms."

Various efforts have been made to develop computer-assisted systems to improve the accuracy of stroke diagnosis and acute stroke triage. The widespread emergence of artificial intelligence technology has been integrated into the field of medicine. Artificial intelligence can play an important role in providing care to patients with stroke. In the past few decades, numerous studies have explored the use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for application in the management of stroke. In this review, we will start with a brief introduction to machine learning and deep learning and provide clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning in various aspects of stroke management, including rapid diagnosis and improved triage, identifying large vessel occlusion, predicting time from stroke onset, automated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) measurement, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcome. This work is focused on providing the current application of artificial intelligence techniques in the imaging of ischemic stroke, including MRI and CT."

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."
