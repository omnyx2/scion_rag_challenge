Both Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offer approaches to feature extraction and analysis in this domain. This overview compares these two techniques, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses in the context of complex image analysis.\n\n##Main Body##\nDeep Learning, particularly through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has been widely applied and is important for various tasks in complex image analysis. Its strengths include its utility in image segmentation, detection, diagnosis of tumors, and general feature extraction. However, Deep Learning faces several significant challenges. These include the requirement for a large number of sufficient training examples, especially problematic for medical image datasets. Further difficulties arise in feature extraction from the entire area of extremely large digital pathological slides (often in gigabytes), the need for ground truth localized annotations, and susceptibility to adversarial effects of input representations. Moreover, while methods like Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) can be used to process large histopathological images by dividing them into patches, this approach often leads to a loss of contextual and spatial information.\n\nDeep Reinforcement Learning, while a newer and emerging technique with less comparative research, presents a promising alternative that addresses some of Deep Learning's limitations. Its primary strength lies in its ability to learn features effectively from limited data without sacrificing crucial contextual and spatial information. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios where Deep Learning struggles due to data scarcity or the inherent loss of context when processing images in fragmented ways. The provided context does not explicitly detail weaknesses of Deep Reinforcement Learning, but rather positions it as a solution to overcome specific challenges faced by Deep Learning.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, Deep Learning, especially with CNNs, is a powerful tool for complex image analysis, excelling in tasks like segmentation and detection. However, it is constrained by data availability, annotation requirements, and challenges with maintaining contextual information in very large images. Deep Reinforcement Learning emerges as a valuable technique capable of mitigating these weaknesses, particularly by learning from limited data while preserving contextual and spatial information, making it a strong candidate for advancing complex image analysis in challenging domains like digital pathology.",

Specifically, our discussion focuses on the use of deep learning to advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. While deep learning can be directly applied to automatic target recognition (ATR), the relevance of these techniques in other radar problems is not obvious. We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling. This framework allows for capture of the non-linearity of the SAR forward model. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this process can be used to learn and compensate for trajectory based phase error for the autofocus problem."
