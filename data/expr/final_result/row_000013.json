This oversight has led to a gap in scholarly and policy discussions regarding the sustainable and responsible management of Big Data.\n\n###Main Body###\nThe primary argument concerning the environmental impact of Big Data initiatives is that their ethical implications, particularly regarding environmental sustainability, have been significantly neglected by scholars and policymakers. The core of this argument lies in recognizing the tangible, material presence of data. Data is not merely an abstract concept; it possesses a physical presence, contributes to the material configuration of digital services, and occupies physical space. This material and situated character of data inherently raises ethical questions within the context of the rapidly expanding Big Data discourse.\n\nTo address these concerns and foster more responsible behavior in data storage and production, the argument emphasizes three key areas requiring attention:\n1.  **Vocabulary in Data Governance**: The language and terminology used when discussing the governance of data initiatives need careful consideration to accurately reflect and address environmental impacts.\n2.  **Tension with Environmental Policies**: There is an inherent internal tension between current Big Data initiatives and existing environmental policies. This conflict needs to be acknowledged and resolved to ensure alignment and prevent adverse environmental outcomes.\n3.  **Issues of Fair Distribution**: The ethical considerations extend to issues of fair distribution, likely referring to the resources consumed, the environmental burden, and the benefits derived from Big Data initiatives.\n\n###Conclusion###\nIn conclusion, the central argument posits that the environmental impact of Big Data initiatives, stemming from the material presence of data, represents a significant and often overlooked ethical challenge. Addressing this requires a shift in perspective to acknowledge data's physical reality and its environmental footprint. By focusing on the vocabulary of data governance, resolving tensions with environmental policies, and ensuring fair distribution, a more responsible and sustainable approach to Big Data storage and production can be achieved.",
