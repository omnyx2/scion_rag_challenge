This task presents a significant challenge in the fields of machine learning and deep learning, particularly for time-series prediction systems. This analysis outlines the key deep learning and machine learning models evaluated for this purpose and their comparative performance based on Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).\n\n##Main Body##\nFor electricity demand prediction, a study analyzed three distinct methods:\n1.  **Error Correction with Multi-Layer Perceptron (eMLP) structure:** This represents a machine learning approach.\n2.  **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) structure:** This is another traditional machine learning method often used for time-series forecasting.\n3.  **CNN-LSTM:** This is a proposed deep learning structure, combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.\n\nThe evaluation of these models was conducted using electricity demand data collected in Germany for home appliances. The prediction accuracy was reported in terms of the Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).\n\nIn terms of comparative performance, the experimental results indicated that the **CNN-LSTM** model significantly **outperforms** both the eMLP and ARIMA structures in accuracy. While the context specifies that MSE and MAPE were used as metrics, it does not provide the specific numerical values for these errors for each model.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, for effective electricity demand prediction, the evaluated models included the machine learning methods eMLP and ARIMA, alongside a deep learning approach, CNN-LSTM. The CNN-LSTM model demonstrated superior accuracy compared to eMLP and ARIMA, as measured by MSE and MAPE, although specific numerical values for these metrics were not detailed in the provided context. This suggests that advanced deep learning architectures like CNN-LSTM are more effective for this challenging time-series prediction problem.",

To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models."

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions."

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores."

Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given."
