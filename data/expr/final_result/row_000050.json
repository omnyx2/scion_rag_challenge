Especially, 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)' was used to compare the robot arm motion difference between before the maintenance(bearing change) and after the maintenance. 6-axies vibration sensor was used to detect the vibration sensing during the motion of the robot arm. The results of the comparison, MD value of the arm motions of the after the maintenance(bearing change) was much lower and stable compared to MD value of the arm motions of the before the maintenance. MD value well distinguished the fine difference of the arm vibration of the robot. The superior performance of the MT method applied to the prediction of the robot trouble was verified by this experiments."

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model."

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."
