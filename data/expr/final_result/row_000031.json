It involves the integration of IT with various industries and technologies to pioneer new markets and develop innovative solutions. The strategic landscape is shaped by governmental efforts and policies, while major industry players and core sectors demonstrate its practical application.\n\n###Main Body###\nThe strategic landscape of IT convergence in Korea is characterized by a proactive governmental approach. The Korean government established an IT convergence policy in 2008, which has since been implemented to foster new national growth engines and accelerate the development of new markets and technologies by converging IT with various industries. Governmental strategies and efforts regarding IT convergence are continuously surveyed to provide insight into ongoing activities. This strategic focus aims to boost the advancement of systems and efficient operations across different sectors. For instance, in the defense sector, IT convergence is seen as a key driver for military reformation, with ongoing discussions about clarifying IT firms' roles, establishing control towers, and ensuring reasonable estimation of software development costs for IT-convergent systems.\n\nMajor industry examples that characterize these developments include prominent Korean companies such as LG, Samsung, and POSCO, which have introduced various convergences. Beyond individual corporations, the government's IT convergence policy has been applied to core industries like automotive, shipbuilding, and defense. Within the defense industry, for example, IT convergence centers have been established to analyze issues, propose frameworks, and develop various business models for applying IT to the defense sector, including areas like weapon acquisition and management, military intelligence, military power construction, and resources management.\n\n###Conclusion###\nIn conclusion, the strategic landscape of IT convergence in Korea is defined by its role as a national growth engine, driven by comprehensive governmental policies and efforts to integrate IT across diverse industries. This is exemplified by the convergence initiatives of major companies like LG, Samsung, and POSCO, as well as the systematic application of IT in core sectors such as automotive, shipbuilding, and particularly the defense industry, where it is leveraged for technological advancement and operational efficiency.",
