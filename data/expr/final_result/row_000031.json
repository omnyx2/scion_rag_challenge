        "title": "IT Convergence in Korea: Strategic Landscape and Industry Examples",
        "introduction": "IT convergence in Korea is a significant trend, recognized as a vital factor for discovering new national growth engines. The government actively surveys and implements strategies to foster this development.",
        "main_body": "The strategic landscape of IT convergence in Korea is characterized by its role in pioneering new markets and developing new technologies. Governmental strategies and efforts are in place to support this trend. A specific area of focus is defense IT convergence, where the technology is seen as a means to enhance weapon systems and operational efficiency for military reformation. However, challenges exist, including the need to clarify IT firms' roles, establish a central control tower for defense IT convergence, and ensure reasonable estimation of software development costs in the defense acquisition process. Major industry examples showcasing IT convergence developments in Korea include the activities of prominent companies such as LG, Samsung, and POSCO.",
        "conclusion": "In summary, IT convergence in Korea is strategically positioned as a key driver for national growth, supported by governmental initiatives and exemplified by the convergent efforts of major industries like LG, Samsung, and POSCO, with a notable focus on advancing the defense sector."
