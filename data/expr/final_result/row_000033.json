            "title": "Key Design Elements and Convergence Concepts of an IT/OT-based Advanced Distribution Management System",
            "introduction": "An Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) is designed to enhance the operational performance of power distribution systems by leveraging global information and functions from various systems. The implementation of such a system fundamentally relies on the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operation Technology (OT).",
            "main_body": "The core convergence concept for an IT/OT-based ADMS involves the blurring of the technical boundary between IT and OT. This convergence is driven by the emergence of new concepts like interoperability and advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and power system technology. To effectively implement an ADMS, IT and OT must be employed together, forming a concept-based IT/OT convergence. This integrated approach allows the ADMS to incorporate new concepts and significantly increase distribution system operation efficiency by utilizing global information and functions from other systems.\n\nThe key design elements of an IT/OT convergence based ADMS system primarily encompass its configurations and functions. These elements are essential for enabling the ADMS to achieve its objective of enhancing distribution system operation performance through the seamless integration and application of IT and OT capabilities.",
            "conclusion": "In summary, the IT/OT convergence is a foundational concept for an Advanced Distribution Management System, enabling it to integrate diverse information and functions. The design of such a system is centered on specific configurations and functions that facilitate this convergence, ultimately leading to improved distribution system operation efficiency."
