This system is designed to enhance distribution system operation performance by integrating various applications. The core of an ADMS lies in the convergence of Information Technology (IT) and Operation Technology (OT), a trend driven by advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and power system technology.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe key design elements of an IT/OT-based ADMS are centered on its ability to leverage both IT and OT to achieve new levels of operational efficiency and functionality. To implement an ADMS, IT and OT must be employed together. The design specifically proposes an IT/OT convergence-based ADMS system design that includes specific configurations and functions. This integration allows the ADMS to operate with global information and functions derived from other systems, thereby increasing distribution system operation efficiency.\n\nThe convergence concepts associated with an IT/OT-based ADMS are primarily driven by the blurring technical boundary between IT and OT. This blurring is facilitated by new concepts such as interoperability. IT/OT convergence itself is a proposed concept arising from the improvements in ICT and power system technology. An ADMS is designed to embody these new concepts, utilizing the combined strengths of IT for data processing and communication, and OT for real-time control and monitoring of the power distribution system. This convergence enables the ADMS to manage and optimize distribution systems more effectively by integrating diverse data sources and operational controls.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn essence, the key design elements of an IT/OT-based ADMS involve the simultaneous employment of IT and OT, leading to a system design that incorporates specific configurations and functions for enhanced operational performance. The fundamental convergence concept is the blurring of the technical boundary between IT and OT, driven by interoperability and advancements in ICT and power system technology, allowing the ADMS to operate with comprehensive global information and functions.",
