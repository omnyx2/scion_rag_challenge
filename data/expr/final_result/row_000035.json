The context provided highlights the importance of understanding consumer perceptions and strategic approaches for market success in the IT convergence industry.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe primary factor shaping consumer purchase attitudes toward IT-based convergence products is the **utility** these products or services provide. This utility is identified as a crucial strategic approach for consumers to adopt such offerings. The research focuses on consumers' perceived purchase attitudes as the foundation for their purchase decision-making.\n\nRegarding the implications for competitiveness, understanding these consumer purchase attitudes is essential for deriving strategies that strengthen corporate competitiveness, which in turn is a key indicator for successful market entry. Furthermore, for enhancing export competitiveness within the IT convergence industry, critical strategies include the **development of export strategic products with competitive technologies** and the provision of **customized marketing support** for IT exporters, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. Other contributing factors for competitiveness include the strategic nature of products, their qualitative level, global market reach, value-added aspects, and robust information systems.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, consumer purchase attitudes toward IT-based convergence products are primarily driven by the **utility** they perceive. For businesses, the implications for competitiveness are significant, necessitating the development of strategies that leverage these attitudes to strengthen corporate standing and ensure successful market entry. Key competitive strategies involve creating **export strategic products with competitive technologies** and offering **customized marketing support**, alongside focusing on product quality, global presence, and value addition.",
