The evaluation aimed to understand the complex interplay between technological development and social integration of Big Data, alongside identifying critical elements that drive user acceptance.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe socio-technical evaluation on Big Data developmental processes, conducted using Normalization Process Theory, focused on understanding how new practices of thinking and enacting related to Big Data are implemented, embedded, and integrated within South Korea. This evaluation revealed insights into the mechanisms through which these new Big Data practices become part of existing systems and workflows.\n\nRegarding the factors influencing user adoption, the study undertook empirical analyses of user modeling. These analyses identified cognitive motivations and user values as the primary determining factors influencing users' adoption of Big Data. This suggests that a user's internal thought processes and their perceived benefits or importance play a crucial role in their willingness to adopt Big Data technologies and practices.\n\n##Conclusion##\nBased on both qualitative and quantitative findings from the socio-technical evaluation and user modeling analyses, the overarching conclusion is that Big Data should be developed with user-centered ideas. Furthermore, the study emphasizes that users should be the central focus of Big Data design to ensure successful implementation, integration, and adoption.",
