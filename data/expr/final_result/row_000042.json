    "result": "##The Role of Large-Scale Machine Learning in Bridging Database Systems and Commercial Applications##\n\n##Introduction##\nLarge-scale machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pivotal force, transforming from a purely academic endeavor into a primary driver of modern commerce and science. Its ability to process vast amounts of data and generate sophisticated models is crucial for connecting the structured world of database systems with the dynamic needs of commercial applications. This integration facilitates the extraction of valuable insights and the development of intelligent functionalities that power various industries.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe role of large-scale machine learning in bridging database systems and commercial applications can be outlined through several key points:\n\nFirstly, **ML acts as a catalyst for modern commerce and science**, transitioning from theoretical research to practical application. The effectiveness of ML models is significantly enhanced by scale, with advancements in tera-scale learning and very large neural networks demonstrating that scale is a critical ingredient for quality modeling. This inherent scalability allows ML to handle the massive datasets typically stored in modern database systems.\n\nSecondly, a primary objective of large-scale ML is to **cross-fertilize research and practical applications between the database and machine learning communities**. This involves introducing current applications, techniques, and systems that enable a seamless flow of information and capabilities. By doing so, ML provides the mechanisms to extract, process, and learn from the data residing in databases, making it actionable for commercial use.\n\nThirdly, large-scale ML facilitates the **extraction of concepts and relations from databases** for use in knowledge-intensive commercial activities. The motivation for ML is to enable computers to learn from data, whether from databases or interactive sessions, and then apply this learned knowledge. For instance, ML is instrumental in developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications, directly leveraging database content to build intelligent commercial tools.\n\nFourthly, **Big Data serves as a fundamental enabler** for successful machine learning algorithms and models. Large and high-quality data, typically managed within database systems, form the essential basis for ML. This highlights the symbiotic relationship where databases provide the raw material, and ML processes it to generate insights and predictive capabilities for commercial applications.\n\nFinally, the integration of large-scale ML involves understanding its **computational models and workflows**, along with the necessary systems support. While significant progress has been made, there are identified critical gaps in the state-of-the-art regarding systems support for established ML use cases and for incorporating recent advances in ML research. Addressing these gaps is crucial for further enhancing the bridge between database systems and commercial applications, ensuring efficient operationalization of ML models within companies.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn conclusion, large-scale machine learning plays a transformative role in bridging database systems and commercial applications by serving as a key driver of modern commerce, leveraging data scale for quality modeling, and fostering inter-community research. It enables the extraction of valuable knowledge from databases to power intelligent commercial applications, with Big Data acting as its foundational resource. Continuous efforts in systems support and workflow optimization are essential to further strengthen this critical bridge, ensuring that the vast potential of ML is fully realized across various commercial domains.",

Rather than attempt to cover all areas of ML, the focus is on its role in building expert systems, its approach to classification problems and ML methods of learning control. A relatively new area, inductive logic programming, is also discussed."

Recently, the performance improvement of the application processor of smartphones has become an opportunity for the machine learning platform to move from the cloud to On-Device AI, and mobile applications equipped with machine learning functions are required. In this paper, machine learning tools for mobile applications are investigated and compared the characteristics of these tools."

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain."
