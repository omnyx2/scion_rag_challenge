        "title": "Principal Concerns and Proposed Solutions for IT Companies in Defense IT Convergence",
        "introduction": "IT convergence technology is crucial for advancing weapon systems and ensuring efficient operations within military reforms in Korea. This study identifies key concerns of IT firms regarding the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems and proposes solutions based on interviews with IT executives.",
        "main_body": "IT companies involved in defense-related IT convergence face three principal concerns. First, there is a need for clarification of IT firms' roles within defense IT-convergent efforts. Second, the establishment of a control tower for defense IT convergence is a significant issue. Third, a reasonable estimation of software development cost in the defense acquisition process is a major concern. To address these issues, the proposed solutions include establishing a control tower for defense IT convergence to improve governance and implementing methods for reasonable estimation of software development costs in the defense acquisition process.",
        "conclusion": "Addressing the clarification of roles, establishing a dedicated control tower, and ensuring reasonable cost estimation are critical steps to facilitate successful IT convergence in the defense sector from the perspective of IT companies."
