However, IT companies involved in this critical process encounter specific challenges within the defense acquisition framework. This document outlines these principal concerns and the proposed solutions, particularly focusing on cost estimation and governance.\n\n##Main Body##\nBased on investigations into IT firms' concerns regarding the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems, three major issues have been identified:\n\n1.  **Clarification of IT Firms' Role:** A primary concern for IT companies is the lack of a clear definition of their role within defense IT-convergent efforts. Ambiguity in roles can lead to inefficiencies, misunderstandings, and difficulties in project execution.\n2.  **Establishment of a Control Tower for Defense IT Convergence:** IT firms express concern over the absence of a central coordinating body or \"control tower\" specifically dedicated to overseeing defense IT convergence. Such a body is considered essential for effective governance, strategic alignment, and streamlined decision-making across various stakeholders.\n3.  **Reasonable Estimation of Software Development Cost:** A significant challenge highlighted by IT companies is the difficulty in achieving a reasonable and accurate estimation of software development costs within the defense acquisition process. Inaccurate or unreasonable cost estimations can lead to financial risks, project delays, and disputes.\n\n##Conclusion##\nTo address these principal concerns, the proposed solutions are directly derived from the identified issues. For **governance**, the establishment of a dedicated \"control tower for defense IT convergence\" is proposed. This entity would provide the necessary oversight, coordination, and strategic direction to clarify roles and streamline the convergence process. For **cost estimation**, the solution lies in implementing methodologies and processes that ensure a \"reasonable estimation of software development cost\" within the defense acquisition framework. By focusing on clarifying roles, establishing robust governance, and improving the accuracy of cost estimations, the defense IT convergence process can become more efficient, transparent, and mutually beneficial for both the defense sector and participating IT companies.",

Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and has been implementing it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. This research analyzes various IT convergence issues based on an operation of defense IT convergence center, one of the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence issues are as follows : the methods for introducing rapid changing IT to military area, rapid deployment procedures of verified commercial technologies and products, regulations for using of domestic software promotion and so on. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and propose the framework and processes for applying IT to our defense sector as one of industries. Also, we establish various business models in the military perspective using defense IT convergence framework. In this paper, we focus the development of defense IT convergence through the alignment of national IT convergence policy and propose various business models established through operating a defense IT convergence center."

This research analyzes and evaluates various IT convergence business models based on an operation of defense IT convergence center from 2011 to 2014, which is the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence business models can be classified into four types of mission area as follows : weapon acquisition and management, military intelligence, military power construction, and resources management.

We analyzes and evaluates various business models designed through defense IT convergence framework and processes."

This study investigated IT firms' concern about the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems and the role of IT firms in the process with Focus Group Interview and in-depth interview on executives of IT firms, and classified the concern to three major issues. They are the clarification of IT firms' role in the defense IT-convergent efforts, the establishment of the control tower for defense IT convergence, and reasonable estimation of software development cost in the defense acquisition process."
