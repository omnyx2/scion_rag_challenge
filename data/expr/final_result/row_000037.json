IT와 BT 융합 기술의 특성**\nIT와 BT 융합 기술은 단일 기술이 아닌 기술 간의 융합을 통해 새로운 가치를 창출하며 다양한 분야에 영향을 미칩니다. 주요 IT 발전은 BT 발전을 위한 혁신적인 장치로 이어지는 특징을 보입니다. 특히, IT는 다른 분야와 가장 활발하게 융합하는 기술로 나타나며, BT는 지식 집약적 특성을 가지며 강력한 협력 네트워크가 중요한 분야로 인식됩니다.\n\n**2. 특허 분석을 통한 융합 강도**\nIT와 BT 융합의 강도는 특허 인용 및 공동 분류 분석(citation and co-classification analyses)을 주요 방법으로 사용하여 측정됩니다. 분석 결과, IT-BT-NT(나노기술) 간의 융합 정도는 2002년 이후 지속적으로 증가하는 추세를 보이고 있습니다. 이는 IT와 BT 융합이 시간이 지남에 따라 더욱 심화되고 있음을 시사합니다.\n\n**3. 특허 분석을 통한 협력 네트워크**\n협력 네트워크 측면에서 BT 분야는 IT-BT-NT 중 조직 내(발명가) 및 조직 간(양수인) 협력이 가장 활발한 것으로 나타났습니다. 이는 BT가 지식 집약적 특성상 연구 및 개발 과정에서 광범위한 협력을 필요로 하기 때문입니다. 국내 중소기업의 IT-BT 융합 기술 기반 네트워크 분석 결과에 따르면, 정부 및 대학 기반의 생태계 구축이 중소기업의 미래 성장에 가장 중요한 요소 중 하나로 밝혀졌습니다. 또한, 중소기업의 기술 융합 방향과 정부 및 대학의 융합 구조 분할 간의 적합성이 중소기업의 역동적인 성장과 긍정적인 관련이 있는 것으로 분석되었습니다. 조직들은 제한된 내부 자원으로 경쟁력을 유지하기 위해 다른 기관들과 협력하며, 기업들은 외부와의 추가 협력을 추구하기 위해 다양한 전략을 수행할 것이 권장됩니다.\n\n##결론##\nIT와 BT 융합 기술은 기술 간의 활발한 상호작용을 통해 새로운 가치를 창출하는 혁신적인 분야입니다. 특허 분석 결과는 이러한 융합의 강도가 지속적으로 증가하고 있음을 보여주며, 특히 BT 분야에서 조직 내외의 활발한 협력이 이루어지고 있음을 강조합니다. 성공적인 융합을 위해서는 정부와 대학을 포함한 다양한 주체 간의 협력 생태계 구축이 필수적이며, 기업들은 외부 협력을 강화하기 위한 전략을 적극적으로 모색해야 할 것입니다.",

This study aims to analyze the IT -BT-NT convergence and differences between technologies in respect of collaboration within (inventor) and between (assignee) organizations. Among the main technologies leading the technological convergence, IT is the most active of converging with other fields. BT is knowledge-intensive and strong cooperative networks are important in this area. NT is applied in various industrial fields upon the basic technology. Using the data on applied and granted patents by Korean applicants in the U.S., this study conducted quantitative analysis and ANOVA to gain the following results. First, the degree of convergence in between IT-BT-NT is continuously increasing since 2002. Second, BT is where the collaboration within and between organizations is the most active among IT-BT-NT. Third, there were certain differences in the degree of convergence according to the years and the fields of technologies in all the IT-BT-NT. Organizations cooperate with other institutions to sustain their competitiveness with limited internal resources. Companies in these fields are recommended to perform diverse strategies to pursue further collaboration with the outside."

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT."
