Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424,","Title: Artificial intelligence in obstetrics, Abstract: This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence for the early diagnosis of variousmaternal-fetal conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth.

While no tools exist to reliably predict the future of artificial intelligence, several tools can help us expand our range of possible futures in order to reduce unexpected surprises, and to create common languages and models that enable constructive conversations about the kinds of futures we would like to occupy or avoid.

However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies. Additionally, we propose methods to improve and promote the certification programs based on the results. These findings provide new knowledge and insights that contribute to the development of AI-based product certification programs., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202326943334293,","Title: Human- versus Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

These issues are primarily due to copyright infringement problems, which arise when the AI is trained on copyrighted content without obtaining authorisation. The music industry is one of the numerous sectors that started to be profoundly impacted by the implementation of AI. South Korea is unquestionably an interesting case study involving the use of AI in the music field. The country has devoted considerable resources to advancing and developing AI technology, with substantial government support, and it has been at the forefront of emerging developments in AI and music, particularly in terms of composition and visuals. These advancements gave rise to many questions regarding AI, ranging from copyright concerns to ethical dilemmas. This paper aims to examine and assess some of the most notable advancements related to artificial intelligence in the Korean music industry.It will begin with the emergence of innovative virtual idols, such as 에스파(Aespa), that incorporate AI and technology in the creation of their concepts. Additionally, it will cover other uses of AI in Korean popular music. For example, this technology can be utilised to strengthen the bond between international fans and artists, as in the case of MIDNATT, who sang multilingual versions of the same song through an AI process.This work will next examine the issues related to AI composers and producers through the case of이봄(EvoM), one of the three most significant AI-based composers globally. For a certain period, EvoM was granted royalties by the Korea Music Copyright Association (KOMCA), which is currently involved in discussions regarding the implementation of a compulsory AI labelling law in the country.Alongside the prospect of Korean regulations, this work also aims to highlight other recent advancements in the field, particularly concerning musical compositions and the use of copyrighted works for training artificial intelligence in the music industry. It focuses on the cases of the new European Union regulations on AI and copyright infringement cases involving music companies in the United States.

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension. Although several hypertension studies using AI have been published recently, most are exploratory descriptive studies that are often difficult for clinicians to understand and have little clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a clinician-centered perspective on AI by showing recent studies on the relevance of AI for patients with hypertension.

Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods.

The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts. However, it worked poor for other beef cuts. This is simply a learning problem for image classifiers., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117816967,","Title: Artificial intelligence and robotics, Abstract: Since Robotics is the field concerned with the connection of perception to action, Artificial Intelligence must have a central role in Robotics if the connection is to be intelligent. Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART16323871,","Title: Digital Skills, Transmedia, and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history.

How do artificial neural networks employ weight matrices and vector mappings to relate inputs and outputs in applied linguistics?,"##Artificial Neural Networks and Their Mathematical Mapping## ##Introduction## Artificial neural networks (ANNs) use mathematical structures to transform linguistic inputs into meaningful outputs. By representing each layer’s activations as vectors and interconnecting them with weight matrices, ANNs provide a framework for modeling complex relationships in language data. ##Main Body## An input vector encodes linguistic features (e.g., word embeddings or syntactic cues). This vector is multiplied by a weight matrix to yield a new vector, which passes through a non-linear activation function to introduce flexibility. In multilayer networks, each subsequent hidden layer repeats this vector-matrix multiplication, enabling the system to capture increasingly abstract linguistic patterns. During training, the network adjusts its weight matrices via optimization algorithms (such as gradient descent) to minimize the difference between predicted output vectors and target outputs, thereby learning the proper mapping from inputs to outputs. ##Conclusion## Through iterative matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations, ANNs learn to map input representations of language into desired outputs, underpinning tasks like translation, parsing, and semantic interpretation in applied linguistics.",없음,없음,"Title: 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)과 대학수학교육, Abstract: 첨단 정보통신기술(ICT)인 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT), 빅데이터(Big Data) 등이 사회와 경제 전반에 융합돼 혁신적인 변화가 일어나는 요즘, 헬스케어, 지능형 로봇, 가정용 인공지능 시스템(스마트홈), 공유자동차 등은 이미 우리 생활에 깊이 영향을 미치고 있다. 이미 오래전부터 공장에서는 로봇이 사람 대신 일을 하고 있으며(FA, OA), 인공지능 의사도 병원에서 활동을 하고 있고(Dr. Watson), 인공지능 스피커(기가지니)와 인공지능 비서인 구글 어시스턴트가 자연어생성을 하며 우리를 돕고 있다. 이제 인공지능을 이해하는 것은 필수가 되었으며, 인공지능을 이해하기 위해서 수학의 지식은 선택이 아니라 필수가 되었다. 따라서 이런 일들을 가능하게 해주는 수학지식을 설명하는 역할이 수학자들에게 주어졌다. 이에 본 연구진은 인공지능과 머신러닝(Machine Learning, 기계학습)을 이해하기 위해 필요한 수학 개념을 우리의 실정에 맞게 한 학기(또는 두 학기) 분량으로 정리하여, 무료 전자교과서 '인공지능을 위한 기초수학'을 집필하고, 인공지능 분야에 관심이 있는 다양한 전공의 대학생과 대학원생을 대상으로 하는 강좌를 개설하였다. 본 논문에서는 그 개발과정과 운영사례를 공유한다. http://matrix.skku.ac.kr/math4ai/, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202014151762669,","Title: 초등 인공지능 교육을 위한 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미 연구, Abstract: 본 연구는 문헌 연구 통해 설명 가능한 인공지능의 개념과 문제해결과정을 탐구하였다. 본 연구를 통하여 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미와 적용 방안을 제시하였다. 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이란 인간과 관련된 인공지능 문제를 다루는 사람 중심의 인공지능 교육으로 학생들은 문제 해결 능력을 함양할 수 있다. 그리고, 알고리즘 교육을 통해 인공지능의 원리를 이해하고 실생활 문제 상황과 관련된 인공지능 모델을 설명하며 인공지능의 활용분야까지 확장할 수 있다. 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이 초등학교에서 적용되기 위해서는 실제 삶과 관련된 예를 사용해야 하며 알고리즘 자체가 해석력을 지닌 것을 활용하는 것이 좋다. 또한, 이해가 설명으로 나아가기 위해 다양한 교수학습방법 및 도구를 활용해야 한다. 2022년 개정 교육과정에서 인공지능 도입을 앞두고 본 연구가 실제 수업을 위한 기반으로써 의미 있게 활용되기를 바란다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202132238500768,","Title: 구성적 인공지능, Abstract: 서양철학의 근간을 이루는 데카르트의 이성주의적 인간이해의 반성으로부터 등장한 구성주의는 지능을 포함한 인간이해의 새로운 대안이 될 수 있을 것으로 생각한다. 구성주의는 진화생물학, 진화심리학, 뇌과학, 시스템이론, 복잡계 이론의 성과뿐만 아니라 나아가 인문사회학의 경향과도 설명을 공유할 수 있는 많은 부분이 있다. 또한 인공지능 분야에서도 구성주의적 방법이라고 할 수 있는 연구가 진행되고 있다. 이 글에서는 구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능에서 다루는 지능에 대한 이해의 지평을 넓히고 이를 기반으로 한 방법론에 대한 검토와 그러한 경향에 있는 일부 인공지능 기술을 살펴보고자 한다. 이러한 논의를 통하여 여러 가지 관점의 마음에 대한 이론과 기술을 상호보완적으로 이해하고 다소 등한히 되고 있는 인공지능의 보편지능(general intelligence)의 토대로 삼고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO200430710415942,","Title: 마음,지능,인공지능, Abstract: 최근 여러 학문 분야에서는 논의되고 있는 인공지능(AI)의 문제는 과학적 문제임과 동시에 중요한 철학적 문제이다.본고는 컴퓨터과학자 혹은 인지과학자들이 내리고 있는 AI의 정의들을 분석함으로써 그 속에 함축되어 있는 논쟁점들을 발굴하고,관련된 논변들을 검토함 으로써 AI탐구가 지니는 의의를 명확히 해보려는 데 그 목적이 있다.AI에 대한 정의들은 AI연구가들의 관심과 목표 그리고 그 주장의 강도에 따라 여러 유형으로 분류될 수 있지만 대개가 인간지능을 어떻게 파악하고 있는지,지능과 뇌의 관계가 무엇인지,그리고 그것을 컴퓨터를 통해서 모의하고 복제한다는 것의 논리적 구조가 무엇인지에 대한 이해와 밀접한 관계가 있다.이점에서 AI연구에 있어서 관건이 되는 것은 컴퓨터 기술의 발전과 같은 경험상의 문제라기 보다는 오히려 논리나 개념분석과 같은 선험적인 문제와 밀접하게 연관되어 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO198911920276086,","Title: 인공지능 생성 콘텐츠(Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)와 인공지능 사용 공개(Artificial Intelligence Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자 인식 연구: 콘텐츠 가치와 형식을 중심으로, Abstract: 최근 생성형 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)은 다양한 형식의 미디어를 포함하여 자율적으로 콘텐츠를 생성할 수 있는 능력으로 주목받고 있다. 그 잠재력에도 불구하고 AI가 생성한 콘텐츠(AI-Generated Content, AIGC)의 진정성(Authenticity) 이슈가 제기됨에 따라 각국에서 AI 사용과 투명성에 대한 규제가 수립되고 있다. 하지만, AIGC와 AI 사용 공개(AI Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자의 이해라는 근본적인 주제는 여전히 탐색되지 않고 있다. 본 연구는 생성형 AI가 제작한 콘텐츠를 실용적, 쾌락적 가치유형으로 구분하고 각각 글, 사진, 영상의 미디어 형식을 적용한 6가지의 경우에 대한 소비자의 인식을 카노 모형을 통해 분석하였다. 나아가, 도출된 결과를 인지된 진정성과 기만으로 그룹을 구분해 인식의 차이가 이에 따라 드러나는지 추가적으로 살펴보았다. 연구 결과, AI가 생성한 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 만족도에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았으나, 뉴스로 대표되는 실용적 콘텐츠에서는 AI 사용에 대한 부정적 인식이 확인되었으며, 특히 뉴스 영상 제작에 있어 부정적 인식이 강하게 드러났다. 반면, 영화와 드라마로 대표되는 쾌락적 콘텐츠에서는 생성형 AI 사용에 대한 인식이 무관심하거나 오히려 긍정적이었다.

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424,","Title: Artificial intelligence in obstetrics, Abstract: This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence for the early diagnosis of variousmaternal-fetal conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth.

While no tools exist to reliably predict the future of artificial intelligence, several tools can help us expand our range of possible futures in order to reduce unexpected surprises, and to create common languages and models that enable constructive conversations about the kinds of futures we would like to occupy or avoid.

However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies. Additionally, we propose methods to improve and promote the certification programs based on the results.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

[2002] The Mind Doesn&rsquo;t Work that Way: The Scope and Limits of Computational Psychology (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA).). The technical improvements of machine learning and deep learning, though, have been continuing and many breakthroughs have occurred recently. This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

These issues are primarily due to copyright infringement problems, which arise when the AI is trained on copyrighted content without obtaining authorisation. The music industry is one of the numerous sectors that started to be profoundly impacted by the implementation of AI. South Korea is unquestionably an interesting case study involving the use of AI in the music field. The country has devoted considerable resources to advancing and developing AI technology, with substantial government support, and it has been at the forefront of emerging developments in AI and music, particularly in terms of composition and visuals. These advancements gave rise to many questions regarding AI, ranging from copyright concerns to ethical dilemmas. This paper aims to examine and assess some of the most notable advancements related to artificial intelligence in the Korean music industry.It will begin with the emergence of innovative virtual idols, such as 에스파(Aespa), that incorporate AI and technology in the creation of their concepts. Additionally, it will cover other uses of AI in Korean popular music. For example, this technology can be utilised to strengthen the bond between international fans and artists, as in the case of MIDNATT, who sang multilingual versions of the same song through an AI process.This work will next examine the issues related to AI composers and producers through the case of이봄(EvoM), one of the three most significant AI-based composers globally.

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension. Although several hypertension studies using AI have been published recently, most are exploratory descriptive studies that are often difficult for clinicians to understand and have little clinical relevance.

The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts. However, it worked poor for other beef cuts.

Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world.

Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects.

###Introduction###
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) provide a foundational framework for understanding human cognition and artificial intelligence, with significant applications in applied linguistics. Within this domain, ANNs employ specific mathematical constructs, namely weight matrices and vector mappings, to establish relationships between input data and desired outputs.

###Main Body###
In the field of applied linguistics, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) relate inputs and outputs primarily through the interaction of vectors and weight matrices. An ANN is fundamentally structured with distinct layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each of these layers is represented by vectors—input vectors, hidden vectors, and output vectors.

The crucial mechanism for transforming information from one layer to the next, and ultimately from input to output, involves weight matrices. These matrices serve as the connections between the vectors of different layers. Specifically, the mapping from an input vector to an output vector within an ANN is achieved through simple matrix multiplication. This mathematical operation, where input vectors are multiplied by corresponding weight matrices, allows the network to process and transform the input data into a meaningful output. The values within these weight matrices are adjusted during the network's training phase, enabling the ANN to learn complex patterns and relationships inherent in the linguistic data.

For instance, in machine linguistics and natural language processing (NLP), ANNs have revolutionized the approach to solving linguistic problems due to their capacity to learn from extensive datasets. This learning process refines the weight matrices, allowing the network to effectively map linguistic inputs (e.g., words, sentences represented as vectors) to desired linguistic outputs (e.g., classifications, translations, or semantic representations).

###Conclusion###
In applied linguistics, artificial neural networks utilize weight matrices and vector mappings as their core operational principle to relate inputs and outputs. Input, hidden, and output information is represented as vectors, and the connections between these vectors are governed by weight matrices. The transformation and mapping of input to output are mathematically executed through matrix multiplication, a process that is refined through learning to enable ANNs to effectively address complex linguistic tasks.",0.6758
What approach and results characterize the system that learns TurKontrol’s POMDP parameters from Mechanical Turk data to optimize iterative crowdsourced tasks?,"##Learning TurKontrol’s POMDP Parameters from Mechanical Turk Data for Dynamic Crowdsourced Task Optimization## ##Introduction## Iterative crowdsourcing workflows often suffer from unpredictable worker reliability and costly redundancies. TurKontrol addresses this by framing quality control as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), yet its practical deployment requires accurate model parameters. A novel system was developed to infer these POMDP parameters directly from large-scale Mechanical Turk data and then use them to guide live task execution. ##Main Body## First, the system aggregates task outcomes and worker responses to estimate key POMDP variables—worker accuracy distributions, transition probabilities for item quality, and voting behavior parameters—through statistical learning techniques. With these learned parameters, it dynamically selects whether to assign new workers, request additional votes, or accept the current result, balancing cost against expected quality improvements. This adaptive control strategy was tested on a successive-improvement editing workflow, continuously observing and updating the POMDP policy as new data accrued. Compared to a fixed-strategy (nonadaptive) workflow using the same budget, the learned POMDP yielded higher-quality final artifacts, demonstrating both effective parameter estimation and cost-efficient decision making. ##Conclusion## By end-to-end learning of TurKontrol’s POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk interactions and applying the model in an adaptive control loop, the system significantly enhances the quality of iterative crowdsourced tasks without increasing expenditure.",없음,없음,"Title: 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)과 대학수학교육, Abstract: 첨단 정보통신기술(ICT)인 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT), 빅데이터(Big Data) 등이 사회와 경제 전반에 융합돼 혁신적인 변화가 일어나는 요즘, 헬스케어, 지능형 로봇, 가정용 인공지능 시스템(스마트홈), 공유자동차 등은 이미 우리 생활에 깊이 영향을 미치고 있다. 이미 오래전부터 공장에서는 로봇이 사람 대신 일을 하고 있으며(FA, OA), 인공지능 의사도 병원에서 활동을 하고 있고(Dr. Watson), 인공지능 스피커(기가지니)와 인공지능 비서인 구글 어시스턴트가 자연어생성을 하며 우리를 돕고 있다. 이제 인공지능을 이해하는 것은 필수가 되었으며, 인공지능을 이해하기 위해서 수학의 지식은 선택이 아니라 필수가 되었다. 따라서 이런 일들을 가능하게 해주는 수학지식을 설명하는 역할이 수학자들에게 주어졌다. 이에 본 연구진은 인공지능과 머신러닝(Machine Learning, 기계학습)을 이해하기 위해 필요한 수학 개념을 우리의 실정에 맞게 한 학기(또는 두 학기) 분량으로 정리하여, 무료 전자교과서 '인공지능을 위한 기초수학'을 집필하고, 인공지능 분야에 관심이 있는 다양한 전공의 대학생과 대학원생을 대상으로 하는 강좌를 개설하였다. 본 논문에서는 그 개발과정과 운영사례를 공유한다. http://matrix.skku.ac.kr/math4ai/, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202014151762669,","Title: 초등 인공지능 교육을 위한 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미 연구, Abstract: 본 연구는 문헌 연구 통해 설명 가능한 인공지능의 개념과 문제해결과정을 탐구하였다. 본 연구를 통하여 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미와 적용 방안을 제시하였다. 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이란 인간과 관련된 인공지능 문제를 다루는 사람 중심의 인공지능 교육으로 학생들은 문제 해결 능력을 함양할 수 있다. 그리고, 알고리즘 교육을 통해 인공지능의 원리를 이해하고 실생활 문제 상황과 관련된 인공지능 모델을 설명하며 인공지능의 활용분야까지 확장할 수 있다. 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이 초등학교에서 적용되기 위해서는 실제 삶과 관련된 예를 사용해야 하며 알고리즘 자체가 해석력을 지닌 것을 활용하는 것이 좋다. 또한, 이해가 설명으로 나아가기 위해 다양한 교수학습방법 및 도구를 활용해야 한다. 2022년 개정 교육과정에서 인공지능 도입을 앞두고 본 연구가 실제 수업을 위한 기반으로써 의미 있게 활용되기를 바란다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202132238500768,","Title: 구성적 인공지능, Abstract: 서양철학의 근간을 이루는 데카르트의 이성주의적 인간이해의 반성으로부터 등장한 구성주의는 지능을 포함한 인간이해의 새로운 대안이 될 수 있을 것으로 생각한다. 구성주의는 진화생물학, 진화심리학, 뇌과학, 시스템이론, 복잡계 이론의 성과뿐만 아니라 나아가 인문사회학의 경향과도 설명을 공유할 수 있는 많은 부분이 있다. 또한 인공지능 분야에서도 구성주의적 방법이라고 할 수 있는 연구가 진행되고 있다. 이 글에서는 구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능에서 다루는 지능에 대한 이해의 지평을 넓히고 이를 기반으로 한 방법론에 대한 검토와 그러한 경향에 있는 일부 인공지능 기술을 살펴보고자 한다. 이러한 논의를 통하여 여러 가지 관점의 마음에 대한 이론과 기술을 상호보완적으로 이해하고 다소 등한히 되고 있는 인공지능의 보편지능(general intelligence)의 토대로 삼고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO200430710415942,","Title: 마음,지능,인공지능, Abstract: 최근 여러 학문 분야에서는 논의되고 있는 인공지능(AI)의 문제는 과학적 문제임과 동시에 중요한 철학적 문제이다.본고는 컴퓨터과학자 혹은 인지과학자들이 내리고 있는 AI의 정의들을 분석함으로써 그 속에 함축되어 있는 논쟁점들을 발굴하고,관련된 논변들을 검토함 으로써 AI탐구가 지니는 의의를 명확히 해보려는 데 그 목적이 있다.AI에 대한 정의들은 AI연구가들의 관심과 목표 그리고 그 주장의 강도에 따라 여러 유형으로 분류될 수 있지만 대개가 인간지능을 어떻게 파악하고 있는지,지능과 뇌의 관계가 무엇인지,그리고 그것을 컴퓨터를 통해서 모의하고 복제한다는 것의 논리적 구조가 무엇인지에 대한 이해와 밀접한 관계가 있다.이점에서 AI연구에 있어서 관건이 되는 것은 컴퓨터 기술의 발전과 같은 경험상의 문제라기 보다는 오히려 논리나 개념분석과 같은 선험적인 문제와 밀접하게 연관되어 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO198911920276086,","Title: 인공지능 생성 콘텐츠(Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)와 인공지능 사용 공개(Artificial Intelligence Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자 인식 연구: 콘텐츠 가치와 형식을 중심으로, Abstract: 최근 생성형 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)은 다양한 형식의 미디어를 포함하여 자율적으로 콘텐츠를 생성할 수 있는 능력으로 주목받고 있다. 그 잠재력에도 불구하고 AI가 생성한 콘텐츠(AI-Generated Content, AIGC)의 진정성(Authenticity) 이슈가 제기됨에 따라 각국에서 AI 사용과 투명성에 대한 규제가 수립되고 있다. 하지만, AIGC와 AI 사용 공개(AI Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자의 이해라는 근본적인 주제는 여전히 탐색되지 않고 있다. 본 연구는 생성형 AI가 제작한 콘텐츠를 실용적, 쾌락적 가치유형으로 구분하고 각각 글, 사진, 영상의 미디어 형식을 적용한 6가지의 경우에 대한 소비자의 인식을 카노 모형을 통해 분석하였다. 나아가, 도출된 결과를 인지된 진정성과 기만으로 그룹을 구분해 인식의 차이가 이에 따라 드러나는지 추가적으로 살펴보았다. 연구 결과, AI가 생성한 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 만족도에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았으나, 뉴스로 대표되는 실용적 콘텐츠에서는 AI 사용에 대한 부정적 인식이 확인되었으며, 특히 뉴스 영상 제작에 있어 부정적 인식이 강하게 드러났다. 반면, 영화와 드라마로 대표되는 쾌락적 콘텐츠에서는 생성형 AI 사용에 대한 인식이 무관심하거나 오히려 긍정적이었다.

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424,","Title: Artificial intelligence in obstetrics, Abstract: This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence for the early diagnosis of variousmaternal-fetal conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth.

In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension.

The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts.

Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects.

###Introduction###
The challenge of quality control in crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk has led to the development of theoretical models such as TurKontrol, which is based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to optimize iterative, crowdsourced workflows. However, the initial proposal of TurKontrol lacked details on how to learn its model parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world crowdsourced environment. This paper addresses these gaps by presenting an end-to-end system designed to learn these parameters from actual Mechanical Turk data and dynamically apply them to optimize live tasks.

###Main Body###
The system's approach to learning TurKontrol's POMDP parameters involves an end-to-end process. It first learns the parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, which is a challenging endeavor due to the large scale of the model and the inherent noisiness of the data, stemming from hundreds of thousands of workers with highly variable abilities. Following the learning phase, the system applies the acquired model to dynamically optimize live crowdsourced tasks. A key aspect of this approach is its ability to model worker accuracy and voting patterns, which are crucial for effective quality control and optimization in iterative crowdsourced workflows. The system validates its model by using it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk.

###Conclusion###
The results characterizing this system demonstrate its significant effectiveness. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, the system produces artifacts that are ""significantly superior"" when compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows, all while utilizing the same amount of financial resources. This indicates that the system successfully addresses the quality control challenges in crowdsourcing by providing a robust, adaptive mechanism for optimizing iterative tasks.",0.6758
What are the key features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture that shape the development and management of sustainable artificial intelligence?,"##Sustainability-Oriented Corporate Culture for Sustainable AI## ##Introduction## As organizations increasingly deploy artificial intelligence to address societal and environmental challenges, the underlying corporate culture plays a decisive role in ensuring that AI applications contribute to sustainable development. A sustainability-oriented culture embeds norms, values, and structures that guide the design, deployment, and governance of AI toward long-term ecological health, social equity, and economic resilience. ##Main Body## 1. Shared Sustainability Values: Organizations with a sustainability-oriented culture articulate clear environmental and social objectives, aligning AI teams around common purpose beyond short-term profit. These values become part of mission statements, performance metrics, and internal communications, steering AI initiatives toward reducing waste, emissions, or inequalities. 2. Leadership Commitment and Incentives: Senior executives visibly champion sustainable AI by tying leadership performance reviews and incentive schemes to sustainability indicators—such as carbon reduction goals or fairness metrics—ensuring that resource allocation and strategic priorities reflect sustainable development aims. 3. Cross-Functional Collaboration: Such cultures foster strong interfaces among data scientists, engineers, ethical specialists, and external stakeholders (e.g., community representatives, NGOs), enabling AI development processes that integrate technical feasibility with environmental impact assessments and social risk evaluations. 4. Transparency and Accountability: Transparency mechanisms—public reporting on AI’s resource consumption, decision-making criteria, and environmental footprints—combined with internal accountability structures (audit committees, ethics boards) help organizations monitor and correct unsustainable AI practices. 5. Continuous Learning and Adaptation: A learning-oriented culture promotes regular training on sustainable AI methods, post-deployment reviews of environmental and social outcomes, and iterative improvements based on feedback loops, thereby institutionalizing best practices like energy-efficient algorithms or bias mitigation techniques. 6. Inclusive Stakeholder Engagement: By proactively involving suppliers, customers, regulators, and affected communities in AI project governance, firms ensure that diverse perspectives shape sustainable AI solutions, anticipate unintended consequences, and build broader support for long-term initiatives. ##Conclusion## A corporate culture that embeds sustainability at every level—from leadership incentives and shared values to transparent practices and continuous learning—provides the essential environment in which sustainable artificial intelligence can flourish. Consequently, companies with such cultural features are better equipped to harness AI’s potential for reducing environmental impact, promoting social equity, and creating resilient economic value over the long term.",없음,없음,"Title: 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)과 대학수학교육, Abstract: 첨단 정보통신기술(ICT)인 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT), 빅데이터(Big Data) 등이 사회와 경제 전반에 융합돼 혁신적인 변화가 일어나는 요즘, 헬스케어, 지능형 로봇, 가정용 인공지능 시스템(스마트홈), 공유자동차 등은 이미 우리 생활에 깊이 영향을 미치고 있다. 이미 오래전부터 공장에서는 로봇이 사람 대신 일을 하고 있으며(FA, OA), 인공지능 의사도 병원에서 활동을 하고 있고(Dr. Watson), 인공지능 스피커(기가지니)와 인공지능 비서인 구글 어시스턴트가 자연어생성을 하며 우리를 돕고 있다. 이제 인공지능을 이해하는 것은 필수가 되었으며, 인공지능을 이해하기 위해서 수학의 지식은 선택이 아니라 필수가 되었다. 따라서 이런 일들을 가능하게 해주는 수학지식을 설명하는 역할이 수학자들에게 주어졌다. 이에 본 연구진은 인공지능과 머신러닝(Machine Learning, 기계학습)을 이해하기 위해 필요한 수학 개념을 우리의 실정에 맞게 한 학기(또는 두 학기) 분량으로 정리하여, 무료 전자교과서 '인공지능을 위한 기초수학'을 집필하고, 인공지능 분야에 관심이 있는 다양한 전공의 대학생과 대학원생을 대상으로 하는 강좌를 개설하였다. 본 논문에서는 그 개발과정과 운영사례를 공유한다. http://matrix.skku.ac.kr/math4ai/, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202014151762669,","Title: 초등 인공지능 교육을 위한 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미 연구, Abstract: 본 연구는 문헌 연구 통해 설명 가능한 인공지능의 개념과 문제해결과정을 탐구하였다. 본 연구를 통하여 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미와 적용 방안을 제시하였다. 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이란 인간과 관련된 인공지능 문제를 다루는 사람 중심의 인공지능 교육으로 학생들은 문제 해결 능력을 함양할 수 있다. 그리고, 알고리즘 교육을 통해 인공지능의 원리를 이해하고 실생활 문제 상황과 관련된 인공지능 모델을 설명하며 인공지능의 활용분야까지 확장할 수 있다. 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이 초등학교에서 적용되기 위해서는 실제 삶과 관련된 예를 사용해야 하며 알고리즘 자체가 해석력을 지닌 것을 활용하는 것이 좋다. 또한, 이해가 설명으로 나아가기 위해 다양한 교수학습방법 및 도구를 활용해야 한다. 2022년 개정 교육과정에서 인공지능 도입을 앞두고 본 연구가 실제 수업을 위한 기반으로써 의미 있게 활용되기를 바란다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202132238500768,","Title: 구성적 인공지능, Abstract: 서양철학의 근간을 이루는 데카르트의 이성주의적 인간이해의 반성으로부터 등장한 구성주의는 지능을 포함한 인간이해의 새로운 대안이 될 수 있을 것으로 생각한다. 구성주의는 진화생물학, 진화심리학, 뇌과학, 시스템이론, 복잡계 이론의 성과뿐만 아니라 나아가 인문사회학의 경향과도 설명을 공유할 수 있는 많은 부분이 있다. 또한 인공지능 분야에서도 구성주의적 방법이라고 할 수 있는 연구가 진행되고 있다. 이 글에서는 구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능에서 다루는 지능에 대한 이해의 지평을 넓히고 이를 기반으로 한 방법론에 대한 검토와 그러한 경향에 있는 일부 인공지능 기술을 살펴보고자 한다. 이러한 논의를 통하여 여러 가지 관점의 마음에 대한 이론과 기술을 상호보완적으로 이해하고 다소 등한히 되고 있는 인공지능의 보편지능(general intelligence)의 토대로 삼고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO200430710415942,","Title: 마음,지능,인공지능, Abstract: 최근 여러 학문 분야에서는 논의되고 있는 인공지능(AI)의 문제는 과학적 문제임과 동시에 중요한 철학적 문제이다.본고는 컴퓨터과학자 혹은 인지과학자들이 내리고 있는 AI의 정의들을 분석함으로써 그 속에 함축되어 있는 논쟁점들을 발굴하고,관련된 논변들을 검토함 으로써 AI탐구가 지니는 의의를 명확히 해보려는 데 그 목적이 있다.AI에 대한 정의들은 AI연구가들의 관심과 목표 그리고 그 주장의 강도에 따라 여러 유형으로 분류될 수 있지만 대개가 인간지능을 어떻게 파악하고 있는지,지능과 뇌의 관계가 무엇인지,그리고 그것을 컴퓨터를 통해서 모의하고 복제한다는 것의 논리적 구조가 무엇인지에 대한 이해와 밀접한 관계가 있다.이점에서 AI연구에 있어서 관건이 되는 것은 컴퓨터 기술의 발전과 같은 경험상의 문제라기 보다는 오히려 논리나 개념분석과 같은 선험적인 문제와 밀접하게 연관되어 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO198911920276086,","Title: 인공지능 생성 콘텐츠(Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)와 인공지능 사용 공개(Artificial Intelligence Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자 인식 연구: 콘텐츠 가치와 형식을 중심으로, Abstract: 최근 생성형 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)은 다양한 형식의 미디어를 포함하여 자율적으로 콘텐츠를 생성할 수 있는 능력으로 주목받고 있다. 그 잠재력에도 불구하고 AI가 생성한 콘텐츠(AI-Generated Content, AIGC)의 진정성(Authenticity) 이슈가 제기됨에 따라 각국에서 AI 사용과 투명성에 대한 규제가 수립되고 있다. 하지만, AIGC와 AI 사용 공개(AI Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자의 이해라는 근본적인 주제는 여전히 탐색되지 않고 있다. 본 연구는 생성형 AI가 제작한 콘텐츠를 실용적, 쾌락적 가치유형으로 구분하고 각각 글, 사진, 영상의 미디어 형식을 적용한 6가지의 경우에 대한 소비자의 인식을 카노 모형을 통해 분석하였다. 나아가, 도출된 결과를 인지된 진정성과 기만으로 그룹을 구분해 인식의 차이가 이에 따라 드러나는지 추가적으로 살펴보았다. 연구 결과, AI가 생성한 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 만족도에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았으나, 뉴스로 대표되는 실용적 콘텐츠에서는 AI 사용에 대한 부정적 인식이 확인되었으며, 특히 뉴스 영상 제작에 있어 부정적 인식이 강하게 드러났다. 반면, 영화와 드라마로 대표되는 쾌락적 콘텐츠에서는 생성형 AI 사용에 대한 인식이 무관심하거나 오히려 긍정적이었다. AI 사용 여부의 공개에 대해서는 콘텐츠 가치유형에 관계없이 지켜야 할 원칙으로 인식되었으나, 실용적 콘텐츠에 대해 그러한 인식이 더 강하게 드러났다. 본 연구는 AI 활용의 투명성과 진정성을 제고하는 방안이 필요함을 시사하며, 향후 AI의 발전과 활용이 소비자 인식에 미치는 영향을 지속적으로 연구할 필요가 있음을 강조한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202408436007069,","Title: Artificial Intelligence, Language Intelligence, and Mathematics, Abstract: Artificial neural networks(ANN) has provided a theoretical framework on the study of human behavior/cognition and artificial intelligence.

For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth.

While no tools exist to reliably predict the future of artificial intelligence, several tools can help us expand our range of possible futures in order to reduce unexpected surprises, and to create common languages and models that enable constructive conversations about the kinds of futures we would like to occupy or avoid.

However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies. Additionally, we propose methods to improve and promote the certification programs based on the results. These findings provide new knowledge and insights that contribute to the development of AI-based product certification programs., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202326943334293,","Title: Human- versus Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects.

In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts. However, it worked poor for other beef cuts. This is simply a learning problem for image classifiers., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117816967,","Title: Artificial intelligence and robotics, Abstract: Since Robotics is the field concerned with the connection of perception to action, Artificial Intelligence must have a central role in Robotics if the connection is to be intelligent. Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART16323871,","Title: Digital Skills, Transmedia, and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history. In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies. The paper also looks at content, its delivery, data and metadata, and the implications for a better world built on the principles of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG’s) for 2030 enacted in 2015 by the United Nations (UN)., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002526105,","Title: Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence is reviewed.

##Introduction##
A sustainability-oriented corporate culture is crucial for shaping the development and management of sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). This culture integrates ethical, social, environmental, and economic considerations into the core operations and strategic decisions related to AI. It moves beyond mere compliance to actively foster an environment where AI solutions contribute positively to society and the planet, while mitigating associated risks.

##Main Body##
The key features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture that influence the development and management of sustainable artificial intelligence include:

1.  **Ethical Principles and Values:** A foundational feature is a strong commitment to ethical principles. This involves ensuring that AI systems accurately interpret and align with human intentions and goals, respecting human values and ethical principles (NART122671508, JAKO202549932405665). Specific ethical considerations include transparency, safety, fairness, and accountability in AI development and use (JAKO202207750091254, NART104750886). This culture actively works to prevent unintended side effects, such as increasing inequality or privacy breaches, and addresses issues like data contamination and bias (NART122671508, JAKO202209541971688). Ethical leadership, characterized by temperance, courage, fairness, and prudence, is vital in fostering such an environment (NART126233487).

2.  **Environmental Responsibility:** A sustainability-oriented culture prioritizes environmental protection in AI initiatives. This means developing AI solutions that help reduce pollution, waste, and carbon footprints, and promoting the use of eco-friendly materials and cleaner production methods (NART122671508, JAKO201415642603283). It also involves reflecting on the environmental impact of big data initiatives, including the physical presence of data and the resource consumption for computing power (NART103720250). AI can be utilized for energy management systems to predict and reduce peak power usage, leading to cost savings and carbon emission reductions (JAKO202401558659086).

3.  **Social Impact and Stakeholder Engagement:** This culture emphasizes the positive social impact of AI and active engagement with stakeholders. It involves a continuous pursuit of a social mission, fostering communication with internal and external stakeholders, and enhancing social reputation (JAKO201609040218160). Key aspects include promoting social integration, contributing to the local community, and ensuring social acceptability of AI solutions (JAKO202207750087253, JAKO201415642603283). For social enterprises, this means striving for community-based social contribution and strengthening partnerships (JAKO202208148825854). The development of AI should consider its broad societal implications, including potential for social division, conflict, and discrimination (DIKO0016956119).

4.  **Innovation and Long-term Growth:** A sustainability-oriented culture encourages innovation that aligns with long-term sustainable development goals. This includes an innovation orientation that drives both social and technological integration (JAKO202207750087253). Companies should perform various innovative activities, maintain transparency in management, and engage in fair competition to ensure economic sustainability (JAKO201415642603283). The culture supports the creation of profit models that coexist with public interest and strategic planning for sustainable development (JAKO202208148825854). It also involves fostering entrepreneurial leadership and ensuring the continuity of leadership (JAKO201609040218160).

5.  **Robust Governance and Management Frameworks:** Effective governance is essential for managing sustainable AI. This includes clear guidelines for AI development, outlining what should and should not be developed, and implementing checklists for design, development, and deployment stages (JAKO202412343246540). A comprehensive evaluation framework like STAGE-AI Metrics, which covers social impact, technical performance, organizational adaptation, sustainability growth, and ethical considerations, is crucial for managing complex risks (JAKO202516964801568). Furthermore, it requires robust data governance, including ensuring data quality, protecting privacy, managing data lifecycles, and establishing dedicated organizations and personnel responsible for data issues (JAKO201813649332298, NART104750886). Top management support is also a significant factor in facilitating the adoption of innovative technologies like big data analytics for sustainable development goals (NART112066192).

6.  **Cultural and Educational Aspects:** Integrating cultural sustainability, which involves inheriting cultures and traditions based on respect for cultural heritage and promoting ethnic and cultural diversity, is also a feature (JAKO201415642603283, JAKO202507739615674). This extends to fostering AI literacy, which includes understanding AI, developing expressive and communicative abilities through AI, creative and convergent media utilization, and ethical competency to responsibly use AI tools (NART134451202). Education programs focused on sustainable development goals (SDGs) and AI literacy are crucial for cultivating future talent with both technical skills and human-centered values (DIKO0016854880, JAKO202520650404296).

##Conclusion##
A sustainability-oriented corporate culture for sustainable AI is characterized by a deep commitment to ethical principles, environmental responsibility, positive social impact, and continuous innovation. It requires robust governance frameworks, including ethical leadership, comprehensive risk management, and transparent data practices. Furthermore, it integrates cultural considerations and emphasizes AI literacy and education to ensure that AI development and management are aligned with human values and contribute to a sustainable future.",0.6758
How can the main applications of machine learning methods for early diagnosis of maternal-fetal conditions and their ethical considerations be summarized?,"##Machine Learning Applications for Early Maternal-Fetal Diagnosis and Ethical Aspects## ##Introduction## Advances in machine learning have enabled earlier and more accurate detection of maternal-fetal complications—such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth—by mining complex biomedical datasets. These predictive tools promise to guide timely clinical interventions, but their deployment raises important ethical questions around patient privacy, data governance, and fairness. ##Main Body## Contemporary methods employ supervised learning algorithms (e.g., support vector machines, random forests, neural networks) to analyze multi-modal inputs: ultrasound images, biochemical markers, electronic health records, and wearable sensor signals. In preterm birth prediction, models integrate demographic factors, cervical measurements, contraction patterns, and inflammatory profiles to achieve high sensitivity in identifying at-risk pregnancies. For fetal growth assessment, algorithms process placental perfusion metrics and biometric parameters to flag intrauterine growth restriction or macrosomia. Rigorous validation—using cross-validation, external cohorts, and ROC analysis—has demonstrated robust performance, though algorithm generalizability can be limited by cohort heterogeneity. Ethical considerations include safeguarding maternal and fetal data privacy, obtaining informed consent for data collection and model use, ensuring transparency and interpretability of model outputs for clinicians and patients, and actively addressing bias stemming from underrepresented subpopulations in training datasets. ##Conclusion## Machine learning holds significant promise for early diagnosis of maternal-fetal conditions by leveraging diverse data sources and advanced predictive models.

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth.

In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for the enhancement of a series of steps in the radiomics pipeline, from image acquisition and preprocessing, to segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model development. The aim of this review is to present the most used AI methods for radiomics analysis, explaining the advantages and limitations of the methods. Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption. Importantly, this review will aim to highlight how AI can assist radiomics in overcoming major bottlenecks in clinical implementation, ultimately improving the translation potential of the method., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART135159628,","Title: Artificial intelligence, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART20606948,","Title: Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging: Clinical Applications, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) powered by deep learning (DL) has shown remarkable progress in image recognition tasks. Over the past decade, AI has proven its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Various aspects of clinical practice in neuroimaging can be improved with the help of AI. For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images. In addition, image quality can be improved via AI-based image reconstruction or motion artifact reduction.

Before his automatic writing, Yeats’s poems were mainly based on Ireland and his love, such as Irish culture and history and his love for Maud Gonne. But with automatic writing his poetics was extended into the history and culture of the world and the Universe. Moreover, Yeats and his wife’s automatic writing is similar to the condition of superintelligence. This paper compares and analyzes similarities between the Yeatses’ automatic writing and the condition of superintelligence of artificial intelligence and tries to trace and compare his ideas and the condition in his poems., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002804250,","Title: Engineering artificial intelligence, Abstract: Current Artificial Intelligence can be used to good effect in engineering systems for emulating some high-level mental functions of humans but is not suitable for coping with many other difficult tasks, especially those involving combined perception and cognition.

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented. Logical languages are widely used for expressing the declarative knowledge needed in artificial intelligence systems.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension. Although several hypertension studies using AI have been published recently, most are exploratory descriptive studies that are often difficult for clinicians to understand and have little clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a clinician-centered perspective on AI by showing recent studies on the relevance of AI for patients with hypertension. The review is organized into sections on blood pressure measurement and hypertension diagnosis, prognosis, and management.

More so, artificial intelligence is gaining wide adoption as it aims to enhance the learning outcomes of students. The purpose of the current research paper was to find out the best artificial intelligence tools for undergraduate students that may be used to enhance their learning results and also discover what students use AI tools for. Method: The purpose was achieved by adopting a survey design to collect data that was analyzed statistically using percentages and pie charts. Findings: The study found out that undergraduate students use ChatGPT, Grammarly, Meta AI, ELSA Speak, Notion AI, BlackBox, Tome.APP, Tabnine, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, AI Notes, Phatomath, Midjourney, StarryAI, Murf, Runway, Copy.AI, Durable or Soundful in their learning process. Such AI tools help them gain a better understanding of the topics related to their study, do assignments, create content faster, write a certain piece of content, get feedback on a given content, and do its translation. The AI tools also organize tasks, review answers, and instruct how to go about answering given tasks. Conclusion and Recommendation: The use of numerous AI tools by undergraduate students enhances learning. The upscaling of AI tool usage requires universities to focus their efforts on integrating AI into their curricula and offering regular training sessions, and workshops. They should also foster continuous research and development in AI and continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI tools and their impact on the performances of students., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202510536006489,","Title: Artificial intelligence, Abstract: AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) is the Science and Engineering domain concerned with the theory and practice of developing systems that exhibit the characteristics we associate with intelligence in human behavior.

Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART27398607,","Title: Classification of Beef by Using Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This paper aims to develop an application that classifies the quality of beef via Artificial Intelligence technology, which has experienced rapid technological growth in recent years. The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts. However, it worked poor for other beef cuts. This is simply a learning problem for image classifiers., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117816967,","Title: Artificial intelligence and robotics, Abstract: Since Robotics is the field concerned with the connection of perception to action, Artificial Intelligence must have a central role in Robotics if the connection is to be intelligent. Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART16323871,","Title: Digital Skills, Transmedia, and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history. In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies.

##Introduction##
Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are rapidly transforming obstetrics and maternal-fetal medicine, offering promising avenues for the early diagnosis and prediction of various conditions. However, alongside these advancements, significant ethical considerations must be addressed to ensure responsible and equitable implementation.

##Main Body##
**Main Applications of Machine Learning for Early Diagnosis of Maternal-Fetal Conditions:**

Machine learning methods are being successfully employed for the early diagnosis of a range of maternal-fetal conditions by leveraging different types of data capture. Key applications include:

*   **Preterm Birth and Abnormal Fetal Growth:** AI is utilized for the early diagnosis of these critical conditions, employing various machine learning methods to analyze diverse data.
*   **Preeclampsia Prediction:** ML and deep learning models, such as random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN), are used to predict preeclampsia based on demographic and clinical data. This aims to identify the condition, which is associated with placental dysfunction and pregnancy-induced hypertension, appearing after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
*   **Perinatal Prognosis:** ML can be applied to predict perinatal outcomes. For instance, studies have investigated the significance of oligohydramnios (low amniotic fluid) in low-risk mothers for predicting perinatal prognosis, although specific findings may vary regarding its independent predictive power.
*   **Risk of Delivery and Prenatal Interventions:** AI-based systems can predict the risk of delivery based on factors like pregnant women's age and inform prenatal nursing interventions by analyzing nursing records.

**Ethical Considerations Associated with Machine Learning in Maternal-Fetal Early Diagnosis:**

The increasing use of AI in maternal-fetal health necessitates careful consideration of several ethical issues:

*   **Data Privacy and Confidentiality:** The use of large medical datasets, including sensitive patient information and genomic data, raises critical concerns about personal information protection and data rights. Proper pseudonymization of research data is essential to safeguard privacy, and data sharing must be managed ethically with minimized commercial interests, as data leakage poses significant risks.
*   **Bias and Discrimination:** AI systems can inherit and amplify biases present in their training data, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes in medical diagnostic applications. Ensuring ""fairness orientation"" and ""overcoming bias"" are crucial ethical principles in AI development and education.
*   **Transparency and Explainability (XAI):** The ""black box"" nature of some AI algorithms can make their predictions opaque, raising questions about trust. Explainable AI (XAI) is vital to provide transparency, allowing medical professionals to interpret and analyze AI algorithms' predictions, thereby strengthening collaboration between AI and clinicians.
*   **Accountability and Liability:** The lack of clear definitions, regulations, and oversight for AI medical practices creates challenges regarding accountability in medical disputes. Establishing clear legal frameworks for AI medical acts, including duties of explanation and care, is necessary to protect patient rights and facilitate swift remedies in cases of adverse events.
*   **Physician-Patient Relationship and Clinical Decision-Making:** AI's role in clinical decision-making impacts the physician-patient relationship. Physicians need adequate education and training to understand and effectively integrate AI tools into their practice, ensuring that AI assists rather than replaces human judgment and empathy.
*   **Regulatory and Standardization Challenges:** The rapid evolution of medical AI technology outpaces regulatory frameworks. There is a need for ethical and clinical validation issues to be addressed, along with the harmonization of international regulatory systems to ensure the safety and effectiveness of AI-based medical products.
*   **Public Trust and Informed Consent:** Ensuring public trust in AI medical services is paramount. This involves guaranteeing patients' right to know about AI involvement in their care and their right to self-determination. Informed consent for biobank-based genomic research, where future study nature may be unforeseeable, also presents complex ethical questions.

##Conclusion##
Machine learning offers transformative potential for the early diagnosis of maternal-fetal conditions, enabling earlier detection of issues like preterm birth, abnormal fetal growth, and preeclampsia. However, realizing these benefits responsibly requires a robust ethical framework. Addressing concerns related to data privacy, algorithmic bias, transparency, accountability, and the evolving role of clinicians is crucial for the safe, equitable, and effective integration of AI into maternal-fetal healthcare. Continuous ethical inquiry, regulatory development, and education are essential to guide the advancement of this technology in a way that respects and protects human dignity and ensures human prosperity and well-being in the AI era.",0.6758

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424,","Title: Artificial intelligence in obstetrics, Abstract: This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence for the early diagnosis of variousmaternal-fetal conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth.

In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

These issues are primarily due to copyright infringement problems, which arise when the AI is trained on copyrighted content without obtaining authorisation. The music industry is one of the numerous sectors that started to be profoundly impacted by the implementation of AI. South Korea is unquestionably an interesting case study involving the use of AI in the music field. The country has devoted considerable resources to advancing and developing AI technology, with substantial government support, and it has been at the forefront of emerging developments in AI and music, particularly in terms of composition and visuals. These advancements gave rise to many questions regarding AI, ranging from copyright concerns to ethical dilemmas. This paper aims to examine and assess some of the most notable advancements related to artificial intelligence in the Korean music industry.It will begin with the emergence of innovative virtual idols, such as 에스파(Aespa), that incorporate AI and technology in the creation of their concepts. Additionally, it will cover other uses of AI in Korean popular music. For example, this technology can be utilised to strengthen the bond between international fans and artists, as in the case of MIDNATT, who sang multilingual versions of the same song through an AI process.This work will next examine the issues related to AI composers and producers through the case of이봄(EvoM), one of the three most significant AI-based composers globally. For a certain period, EvoM was granted royalties by the Korea Music Copyright Association (KOMCA), which is currently involved in discussions regarding the implementation of a compulsory AI labelling law in the country.Alongside the prospect of Korean regulations, this work also aims to highlight other recent advancements in the field, particularly concerning musical compositions and the use of copyrighted works for training artificial intelligence in the music industry.

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension. Although several hypertension studies using AI have been published recently, most are exploratory descriptive studies that are often difficult for clinicians to understand and have little clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a clinician-centered perspective on AI by showing recent studies on the relevance of AI for patients with hypertension.

The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts. However, it worked poor for other beef cuts.

Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects.

AI 사용 공개는 콘텐츠 가치에 관계없이 ‘지켜야 할 원칙’으로 여겨졌으나, 실용적 콘텐츠에서 그 중요성이 더 크게 드러났다. ##결론## 소비자는 콘텐츠의 가치 유형과 형식에 따라 AIGC와 AI 사용 공개에 상이한 태도를 보인다. 뉴스 같은 정보성 콘텐츠에서는 투명성과 진정성 확보 노력이 필수적하며, 쾌락적 영역에서는 경험 개선을 위한 활용이 가능하다. 향후 AI 활용의 신뢰도를 높이기 위해 진정성 강화 및 투명성 제고 방안을 지속적으로 모색해야 한다.",How can you summarize the recognition characteristics of consumer awareness and AI disclosure by value type?,"##title## Producted AI Content Value and Family -specific Consumer Recognition and AI Public Attitude Analysis ##introduction## Productive artificial intelligence (AIGC) has the ability to generate autonomous generations in various media formats, but due to authenticity, regulations and transparency demands are increasing. It is important to understand how consumers recognize AIGC and how they accept AI disclosure. This study analyzed consumer perception in six scenarios that combine content value types (practical and pleasure) and media formats (text, photographs, and videos). ## Main ## Using the cano model, the group was measured by measuring the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of each scenario, and the group was distinguished according to the recognized authenticity and deceit. In practical contents (especially news), negative perceptions of AI use were prevailed, and the intensity in video news was the largest. On the other hand, in pleasure contents (movies and dramas), interest in using AI was low or rather positive. The disclosure of the use of AI was regarded as a ""principle to be kept,"" regardless of the value of the content, but its importance was even greater in practical contents. ##conclusion## Consumers show different attitudes in the release of AIGC and AI according to the value types and forms of the content. Efforts to secure transparency and authenticity are essential for information content such as news, and in pleasure areas, it is possible to improve experience.

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424,","Title: Artificial intelligence in obstetrics, Abstract: This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence for the early diagnosis of variousmaternal-fetal conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth.

However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for the enhancement of a series of steps in the radiomics pipeline, from image acquisition and preprocessing, to segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model development. The aim of this review is to present the most used AI methods for radiomics analysis, explaining the advantages and limitations of the methods. Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption. Importantly, this review will aim to highlight how AI can assist radiomics in overcoming major bottlenecks in clinical implementation, ultimately improving the translation potential of the method., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART135159628,","Title: Artificial intelligence, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART20606948,","Title: Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging: Clinical Applications, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) powered by deep learning (DL) has shown remarkable progress in image recognition tasks. Over the past decade, AI has proven its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Various aspects of clinical practice in neuroimaging can be improved with the help of AI. For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images. In addition, image quality can be improved via AI-based image reconstruction or motion artifact reduction.

Before his automatic writing, Yeats’s poems were mainly based on Ireland and his love, such as Irish culture and history and his love for Maud Gonne. But with automatic writing his poetics was extended into the history and culture of the world and the Universe. Moreover, Yeats and his wife’s automatic writing is similar to the condition of superintelligence. This paper compares and analyzes similarities between the Yeatses’ automatic writing and the condition of superintelligence of artificial intelligence and tries to trace and compare his ideas and the condition in his poems., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002804250,","Title: Engineering artificial intelligence, Abstract: Current Artificial Intelligence can be used to good effect in engineering systems for emulating some high-level mental functions of humans but is not suitable for coping with many other difficult tasks, especially those involving combined perception and cognition.

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented. Logical languages are widely used for expressing the declarative knowledge needed in artificial intelligence systems.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension. Although several hypertension studies using AI have been published recently, most are exploratory descriptive studies that are often difficult for clinicians to understand and have little clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a clinician-centered perspective on AI by showing recent studies on the relevance of AI for patients with hypertension. The review is organized into sections on blood pressure measurement and hypertension diagnosis, prognosis, and management.

More so, artificial intelligence is gaining wide adoption as it aims to enhance the learning outcomes of students. The purpose of the current research paper was to find out the best artificial intelligence tools for undergraduate students that may be used to enhance their learning results and also discover what students use AI tools for. Method: The purpose was achieved by adopting a survey design to collect data that was analyzed statistically using percentages and pie charts. Findings: The study found out that undergraduate students use ChatGPT, Grammarly, Meta AI, ELSA Speak, Notion AI, BlackBox, Tome.APP, Tabnine, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, AI Notes, Phatomath, Midjourney, StarryAI, Murf, Runway, Copy.AI, Durable or Soundful in their learning process. Such AI tools help them gain a better understanding of the topics related to their study, do assignments, create content faster, write a certain piece of content, get feedback on a given content, and do its translation. The AI tools also organize tasks, review answers, and instruct how to go about answering given tasks. Conclusion and Recommendation: The use of numerous AI tools by undergraduate students enhances learning. The upscaling of AI tool usage requires universities to focus their efforts on integrating AI into their curricula and offering regular training sessions, and workshops. They should also foster continuous research and development in AI and continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI tools and their impact on the performances of students., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202510536006489,","Title: Artificial intelligence, Abstract: AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) is the Science and Engineering domain concerned with the theory and practice of developing systems that exhibit the characteristics we associate with intelligence in human behavior.

Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART27398607,","Title: Classification of Beef by Using Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This paper aims to develop an application that classifies the quality of beef via Artificial Intelligence technology, which has experienced rapid technological growth in recent years. The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts. However, it worked poor for other beef cuts. This is simply a learning problem for image classifiers., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117816967,","Title: Artificial intelligence and robotics, Abstract: Since Robotics is the field concerned with the connection of perception to action, Artificial Intelligence must have a central role in Robotics if the connection is to be intelligent. Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART16323871,","Title: Digital Skills, Transmedia, and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history. In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies.

##서론##
생성형 인공지능(AI) 기술의 발전은 다양한 형태의 콘텐츠 제작과 소비 방식에 혁신을 가져오고 있다. 이러한 변화 속에서 생성형 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 콘텐츠의 가치 유형과 AI 사용 공개 여부에 따라 복합적인 양상을 보인다. 본 요약은 관련 연구들을 통해 생성형 AI 콘텐츠의 가치 유형별 소비자 인식과 AI 사용 공개에 대한 인식 특성을 종합적으로 분석한다.

##본론##
###1. 생성형 AI 콘텐츠의 가치 유형별 소비자 인식###
생성형 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 콘텐츠가 제공하는 가치 유형에 따라 상이하게 나타난다.

*   **실용적 콘텐츠:** 뉴스와 같이 실용적 가치를 제공하는 콘텐츠의 경우, AI 사용에 대한 소비자들의 부정적 인식이 강하게 나타났다. 특히 뉴스 영상 제작에 AI가 활용될 때 이러한 부정적 인식이 더욱 두드러진다. 이는 실용적 콘텐츠에서 요구되는 진정성과 신뢰성 때문으로 해석될 수 있다.
*   **쾌락적 콘텐츠:** 영화나 드라마와 같이 쾌락적 가치를 제공하는 콘텐츠의 경우, 생성형 AI 사용에 대한 소비자들의 인식이 무관심하거나 오히려 긍정적인 경향을 보였다. 이는 쾌락적 콘텐츠의 경우 창작의 주체보다는 콘텐츠 자체의 즐거움에 더 집중하기 때문으로 풀이된다.
*   **예술적/상업적 콘텐츠:** AI 창작물의 오리지널리티(진정성, 독특성, 창의성)는 소비자의 신뢰, 유용성, 태도, 사용 의도에 영향을 미친다. 예술적 맥락에서는 인간-AI 협업이 진정성과 신뢰를 강화하는 반면, 상업적 맥락에서는 유용성과 신뢰가 더 중요하게 부각되며, AI 단독 창작물이 효율성과 혁신성 측면에서 더 창의적으로 인식될 수 있다.
*   **이미지 중심 AI:** 이미지 생성형 AI에 대한 대중의 인식은 '편리함'을 긍정적인 주요 이유로 꼽았으나, '불분명한 저작권 문제'를 부정적인 이유로 지적했다. 유용성은 지각된 가치에 긍정적 영향을 미치지만, 비용과 기술성은 부정적 영향을 미치는 것으로 나타났다.
*   **AI 웹툰:** 웹툰 이용자들은 생성형 AI 웹툰에서 AI 활용 정도를 가장 중요하게 고려하며, AI가 보조적으로(30% 이하) 활용되는 것을 선호한다. 특히 그림 작업에 AI가 적용되는 것을 선호하는 경향을 보였다.
*   **사용자 그룹별 차이:** 일반 사용자 집단은 생성형 AI 사용에 대해 전반적으로 긍정적인 인식을 갖는 반면, 디자인 관계자 집단은 부정적인 인식을 보이며, AI 결과물의 표절, 도용, 저작권 보호 법제화의 현실 가능성에 대한 우려를 표출했다.

###2. AI 사용 공개에 대한 인식 특성###
생성형 AI 사용 공개(AI Disclaimer)는 소비자 인식에 중요한 영향을 미치며, 그 특성은 다음과 같다.

*   **원칙적 인식:** AI 사용 여부의 공개는 콘텐츠 가치 유형에 관계없이 지켜야 할 원칙으로 인식되지만, 뉴스와 같은 실용적 콘텐츠에 대해 이러한 인식이 더욱 강하게 나타난다. 이는 실용적 콘텐츠의 경우 정보의 투명성과 진정성이 더욱 중요하게 여겨지기 때문이다.
*   **부정적 편향:** 생성형 AI로 제작된 광고임을 소비자가 인지한 경우, 그렇지 않은 경우보다 광고 제품에 대한 인지된 가치(기능적, 감성적)가 낮게 나타났다. 동일한 음식 광고 이미지라도 ""AI 이미지입니다""라는 설명이 제시될 경우, 사실성 인식, 시각적 만족도, 브랜드 태도, 구매 의도 등 모든 평가 지표에서 점수가 낮아지는 경향을 보였다. 이는 AI 생성 콘텐츠라는 외연적 정보가 기술적 완성도보다 소비자 반응에 더 큰 영향을 미 미칠 수 있음을 시사한다.
*   **AI 리터러시의 조절 효과:** AI 리터러시 수준이 높은 소비자는 AI 생성 광고에 대해 더 긍정적인 태도를 보이며, 제작 방식 표시에 덜 영향을 받는다. 반면, AI 리터러시가 낮은 소비자는 AI 표시에 대한 편견으로 인해 AI 생성 광고에 대해 더 부정적인 태도를 보이는 것으로 나타났다.
*   **정보원 공신력의 중요성:** 생성형 AI 활용 영상 광고에서 AI 활용 표기 위치(전반, 후반) 자체는 광고 태도에 직접적인 영향을 미치지 않았다. 그러나 정보원 공신력(전문성 및 신뢰성)이 높고 긍정적 정서와 결합될 때 광고 태도가 유의미하게 개선되었으며, 부정적 정서와 결합된 경우에도 부정적 영향을 완화하는 경향을 보였다. 이는 AI 활용 광고의 투명성과 소비자 신뢰 확보를 위한 고지 전략의 중요성을 강조한다.

##결론##
생성형 AI 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 콘텐츠의 실용성, 쾌락성, 예술성, 상업성 등 가치 유형에 따라 다르게 나타난다. 특히 실용적이고 진정성이 요구되는 콘텐츠에서는 AI 사용에 대한 부정적 인식이 강하며, 저작권 문제에 대한 우려도 크다. AI 사용 공개는 투명성과 신뢰를 위한 중요한 원칙으로 인식되지만, 'AI 생성'이라는 사실 자체가 소비자에게 부정적인 편향을 유발할 수 있다. 이러한 편향은 소비자의 AI 리터러시 수준에 따라 다르게 나타나며, 정보원 공신력이 높은 경우 부정적 인식을 완화할 수 있다. 따라서 생성형 AI 콘텐츠를 제작하고 활용할 때는 콘텐츠의 특성과 소비자의 인식 수준을 고려한 맞춤형 전략과 함께, 투명하고 신뢰성 있는 고지 전략을 통해 소비자 수용도를 높이는 노력이 필요하다.",0.6758

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424,","Title: Artificial intelligence in obstetrics, Abstract: This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence for the early diagnosis of variousmaternal-fetal conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth.

However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations?

It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts.

Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects.

항공 분야 인공지능의 기본 개념, 산업적 의미 및 직면 과제

##서론##
항공 분야에서 인공지능(AI)은 최소한의 인간 개입으로 지능적인 기계를 구현하는 핵심 기술로 자리 잡고 있습니다. 이는 1956년에 탄생한 AI의 기본 개념을 바탕으로, 항공 산업 전반의 효율성, 안전성, 그리고 운영 의사결정을 혁신하는 중요한 역할을 수행하고 있습니다. 그러나 이러한 기술의 도입은 동시에 다양한 산업적 의미와 함께 윤리적, 기술적, 법적, 사회적 과제들을 야기하고 있습니다.

##본론##
###1. 인공지능의 기본 개념 (항공 분야 적용)###
항공 분야에서 인공지능은 컴퓨터를 활용하여 인간의 개입을 최소화하면서 지능적인 기계를 만드는 포괄적인 개념을 의미합니다. 이는 다차원 신경망 기반의 지능형 시스템을 구축하고 운영하는 원리를 연구하는 지식 분야에 해당합니다. 구체적으로, 인공지능은 신경망 요소, 기억 체계, 인공 지능 시스템의 '뇌' 기능 조직, 센서 및 모터 시스템, 반사 작용, 동기 부여, 목적 지향적 행동, '사고', '의식', '잠재의식' 및 학습과 교육을 통해 개발된 '인공 인격' 등을 포함합니다. 항공 분야에서는 이러한 기본 개념을 바탕으로 머신러닝(ML) 기반 시스템 개발, 상황 인식을 위한 정보 융합 기술 적용, 그리고 다양한 운영 과정의 지능형 자동화에 활용됩니다.

###2. 인공지능의 산업적 의미###
인공지능은 항공 산업을 '스마트 항공'으로 전환하며 다음과 같은 중요한 산업적 의미를 가집니다.
*   **효율성 및 안전성 향상**: 지능형 비행 스케줄링, 비행 경로 최적화, 지능형 항공기 정비, 항공 교통 관리, 공항 서비스 및 항공 안전 등 전반적인 운영 효율성과 안전성을 크게 향상시킵니다.
*   **의사결정 최적화**: 지휘통제 시스템의 지능화 및 자동화 수준을 높여 충돌 방지 및 최적의 운영 효율성을 위한 비행 경로 예측 및 안내를 가능하게 합니다. 또한, 지휘관에게 최적의 정책 대안을 제공하여 신속하고 정확한 의사결정을 지원합니다.
*   **신규 서비스 및 가치 창출**: 가상 비서, 스마트 항공전자와 같은 혁신적인 응용 시나리오를 창출하고, 산업 생태계를 재편하며 가치 사슬을 재구축합니다. 무인항공기(UAV)의 활용 범위를 다양한 분야로 확장시킵니다.
*   **업무 자동화 및 인력 재배치**: 예약 발권, 공항 여객 서비스, 공항 보안 서비스와 같은 단순 반복 업무를 인공지능 및 로봇 서비스로 대체하여 인력의 효율적인 재배치를 가능하게 합니다.
*   **기술 융합 및 혁신 촉진**: 빅데이터 분석, 사물 인터넷(IoT) 등 다른 첨단 기술과의 융합을 통해 항공 산업의 기술 트렌드를 예측하고 미래 발전 방향을 제시하는 데 기여합니다.

###3. 인공지능이 직면한 과제###
항공 분야에서 인공지능의 광범위한 적용은 다음과 같은 과제들을 직면하고 있습니다.
*   **기술적 한계 및 신뢰성 문제**: 머신러닝 기반 AI는 결정론적 특성과 설명 가능성을 내재한 기존 항공 소프트웨어 인증 표준(예: DO-178C, DO-278A)으로는 신뢰성을 보증하기 어렵습니다. 데이터 통합, 알고리즘 신뢰성, 네트워크 보안 등 기술적 문제 해결이 필요합니다.
*   **윤리적 및 사회적 문제**: 인공지능의 광범위한 적용은 윤리적 문제와 함께 전문가 및 전문 인력의 미래 역할에 대한 논의를 필요로 합니다. 특히 감성과 창의력을 요구하는 직무는 AI로 대체하기 어렵다는 인식이 있으며, 단순 업무의 대체로 인한 일자리 위협에 대한 우려가 존재합니다.
*   **법적 및 제도적 미비**: 인공지능 오류나 해킹으로 인한 사고 발생 시 대응의 어려움과 보상·배상 체계의 불명확성이 문제입니다. 도심항공교통(UAM)과 같은 인공지능 모빌리티의 경우, 책임보험 가입 의무에도 불구하고 표준 약관 부재 및 보험료율 산정 곤란으로 보험 인수가 거절되는 경우가 많아 법적 정비가 시급합니다.
*   **보안 위협 증대**: 인공지능 기술의 악용 가능성으로 인해 항공 테러리즘의 양상이 변화하고, 지능화된 공항 시설 및 운영 시스템의 사이버 보안 취약성이 증가하고 있습니다. 이에 대한 대응 체계 강화와 국제 협력 네트워크 구축이 필요합니다.
*   **데이터 확보 및 관리**: 고성능 AI 구현을 위해서는 관련 고품질 데이터의 축적이 필수적이지만, 실제 연료 소모량 자료와 같은 핵심 데이터는 항공사의 내부 자료로 공개되지 않아 확보에 어려움이 있습니다.

##결론##
항공 분야에서 인공지능은 효율성, 안전성, 운영 최적화를 통해 산업의 패러다임을 '스마트 항공'으로 전환하는 강력한 동력입니다. 그러나 기술적 신뢰성 확보, 윤리적 문제 해결, 법적·제도적 기반 마련, 그리고 새로운 보안 위협에 대한 대응은 인공지능의 성공적인 통합과 지속 가능한 발전을 위해 반드시 해결해야 할 핵심 과제입니다. 이러한 과제들을 극복하기 위한 지속적인 연구 개발, 정책적 지원, 그리고 산업계와 규제 당국의 긴밀한 협력이 요구됩니다.",0.6758
구성주의 관점에서 인공지능 연구가 확장한 지능 이해의 지평과 주요 기술 동향을 어떻게 요약할 수 있나요?,"##제목## 구성주의 관점의 인공지능 지능 이해 지평 확장과 주요 기술 동향 ##서론## 구성주의는 데카르트적 이성주의를 넘어 진화생물학·진화심리학·뇌과학·시스템 이론·복잡계 이론 등 여러 학문적 성과를 통합하여 지능을 환경과 상호작용하며 능동적으로 형성되는 현상으로 이해한다. 이러한 관점은 전통적 상징처리 모델과 달리 경험적이고 맥락적이며 다층적인 학습 과정을 강조한다. ##본론## 첫째, 구성주의적 접근은 에이전트가 자신의 지식 구조를 환경과의 지속적 상호작용을 통해 스스로 재구성하도록 설계된 인공생명(Artificial Life)과 군집지능(Swarm Intelligence) 연구를 활성화시켰다. 둘째, 심층강화학습과 예측부호화(Predictive Coding) 같은 기술은 에이전트 기반 프레임워크로 전환되어, 맥락 인식과 적응 능력을 강화하며 구성주의 이론을 실현하고 있다. 셋째, 구성주의는 인지적·정서적 요소를 함께 다루는 설명 가능한 AI 및 인간-기계 협업 시스템 설계에도 적용되어, 신뢰형 AI와 교육·심리치료 등 다양한 분야에서 혁신적 접근을 가능하게 한다. ##결론## 구성주의 관점은 지능을 단순 정보 처리 능력 이상으로 보고, 분산 에이전트와 상호작용 기반 학습을 핵심 원리로 제시함으로써 AI 연구의 지평을 넓힌다. 이는 범용지능 실현과 인간 수준의 협업형 AI 개발을 위한 중요한 이론적 토대를 제공한다.",How can we summarize the horizon and major technical trends that have expanded by artificial intelligence research from the perspective of components?,"##title## The extension of the horizon of artificial intelligence understanding in terms of constructivist and major technology trends ##introduction## Configurationism is understood as a phenomenon in which intelligence interacts with the environment by integrating various academic achievements such as evolutionary biology, evolutionary psychology, brain science, system theory, and complexity theory beyond Descartic rationalism. This perspective emphasizes emphasis on empirical, contextual, and multilayer, unlike traditional symbolism models. ## Main ## First, the constructive approach activated the study of artificial life and swarm intelligence designed to reconstruct their knowledge structure through continuous interaction with the environment. Second, technologies such as in -depth enhancement learning and predictive coding are converted into agent -based frameworks, enhancing context recognition and adaptation ability and realizing constructivism theory. Third, constructivism is also applied to the designable AI and human-machine collaboration system design that deals with cognitive and emotional elements, enabling innovative approaches in various fields such as trust AI and education and psychological therapy. ##conclusion## Configuration's perspective seeks the horizon of AI research by viewing intelligence beyond simple information processing ability and presenting interaction -based learning with distributed agents as a key principle. This provides an important theoretical foundation for the realization of general intelligence and the development of human -level collaborative AI.","Title: 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)과 대학수학교육, Abstract: 첨단 정보통신기술(ICT)인 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT), 빅데이터(Big Data) 등이 사회와 경제 전반에 융합돼 혁신적인 변화가 일어나는 요즘, 헬스케어, 지능형 로봇, 가정용 인공지능 시스템(스마트홈), 공유자동차 등은 이미 우리 생활에 깊이 영향을 미치고 있다. 이미 오래전부터 공장에서는 로봇이 사람 대신 일을 하고 있으며(FA, OA), 인공지능 의사도 병원에서 활동을 하고 있고(Dr. Watson), 인공지능 스피커(기가지니)와 인공지능 비서인 구글 어시스턴트가 자연어생성을 하며 우리를 돕고 있다. 이제 인공지능을 이해하는 것은 필수가 되었으며, 인공지능을 이해하기 위해서 수학의 지식은 선택이 아니라 필수가 되었다. 따라서 이런 일들을 가능하게 해주는 수학지식을 설명하는 역할이 수학자들에게 주어졌다. 이에 본 연구진은 인공지능과 머신러닝(Machine Learning, 기계학습)을 이해하기 위해 필요한 수학 개념을 우리의 실정에 맞게 한 학기(또는 두 학기) 분량으로 정리하여, 무료 전자교과서 '인공지능을 위한 기초수학'을 집필하고, 인공지능 분야에 관심이 있는 다양한 전공의 대학생과 대학원생을 대상으로 하는 강좌를 개설하였다. 본 논문에서는 그 개발과정과 운영사례를 공유한다. http://matrix.skku.ac.kr/math4ai/, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202014151762669,","Title: 초등 인공지능 교육을 위한 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미 연구, Abstract: 본 연구는 문헌 연구 통해 설명 가능한 인공지능의 개념과 문제해결과정을 탐구하였다. 본 연구를 통하여 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미와 적용 방안을 제시하였다. 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이란 인간과 관련된 인공지능 문제를 다루는 사람 중심의 인공지능 교육으로 학생들은 문제 해결 능력을 함양할 수 있다. 그리고, 알고리즘 교육을 통해 인공지능의 원리를 이해하고 실생활 문제 상황과 관련된 인공지능 모델을 설명하며 인공지능의 활용분야까지 확장할 수 있다. 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이 초등학교에서 적용되기 위해서는 실제 삶과 관련된 예를 사용해야 하며 알고리즘 자체가 해석력을 지닌 것을 활용하는 것이 좋다. 또한, 이해가 설명으로 나아가기 위해 다양한 교수학습방법 및 도구를 활용해야 한다. 2022년 개정 교육과정에서 인공지능 도입을 앞두고 본 연구가 실제 수업을 위한 기반으로써 의미 있게 활용되기를 바란다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202132238500768,","Title: 구성적 인공지능, Abstract: 서양철학의 근간을 이루는 데카르트의 이성주의적 인간이해의 반성으로부터 등장한 구성주의는 지능을 포함한 인간이해의 새로운 대안이 될 수 있을 것으로 생각한다. 구성주의는 진화생물학, 진화심리학, 뇌과학, 시스템이론, 복잡계 이론의 성과뿐만 아니라 나아가 인문사회학의 경향과도 설명을 공유할 수 있는 많은 부분이 있다. 또한 인공지능 분야에서도 구성주의적 방법이라고 할 수 있는 연구가 진행되고 있다. 이 글에서는 구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능에서 다루는 지능에 대한 이해의 지평을 넓히고 이를 기반으로 한 방법론에 대한 검토와 그러한 경향에 있는 일부 인공지능 기술을 살펴보고자 한다. 이러한 논의를 통하여 여러 가지 관점의 마음에 대한 이론과 기술을 상호보완적으로 이해하고 다소 등한히 되고 있는 인공지능의 보편지능(general intelligence)의 토대로 삼고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO200430710415942,","Title: 마음,지능,인공지능, Abstract: 최근 여러 학문 분야에서는 논의되고 있는 인공지능(AI)의 문제는 과학적 문제임과 동시에 중요한 철학적 문제이다.본고는 컴퓨터과학자 혹은 인지과학자들이 내리고 있는 AI의 정의들을 분석함으로써 그 속에 함축되어 있는 논쟁점들을 발굴하고,관련된 논변들을 검토함 으로써 AI탐구가 지니는 의의를 명확히 해보려는 데 그 목적이 있다.AI에 대한 정의들은 AI연구가들의 관심과 목표 그리고 그 주장의 강도에 따라 여러 유형으로 분류될 수 있지만 대개가 인간지능을 어떻게 파악하고 있는지,지능과 뇌의 관계가 무엇인지,그리고 그것을 컴퓨터를 통해서 모의하고 복제한다는 것의 논리적 구조가 무엇인지에 대한 이해와 밀접한 관계가 있다.이점에서 AI연구에 있어서 관건이 되는 것은 컴퓨터 기술의 발전과 같은 경험상의 문제라기 보다는 오히려 논리나 개념분석과 같은 선험적인 문제와 밀접하게 연관되어 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO198911920276086,","Title: 인공지능 생성 콘텐츠(Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)와 인공지능 사용 공개(Artificial Intelligence Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자 인식 연구: 콘텐츠 가치와 형식을 중심으로, Abstract: 최근 생성형 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)은 다양한 형식의 미디어를 포함하여 자율적으로 콘텐츠를 생성할 수 있는 능력으로 주목받고 있다. 그 잠재력에도 불구하고 AI가 생성한 콘텐츠(AI-Generated Content, AIGC)의 진정성(Authenticity) 이슈가 제기됨에 따라 각국에서 AI 사용과 투명성에 대한 규제가 수립되고 있다. 하지만, AIGC와 AI 사용 공개(AI Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자의 이해라는 근본적인 주제는 여전히 탐색되지 않고 있다. 본 연구는 생성형 AI가 제작한 콘텐츠를 실용적, 쾌락적 가치유형으로 구분하고 각각 글, 사진, 영상의 미디어 형식을 적용한 6가지의 경우에 대한 소비자의 인식을 카노 모형을 통해 분석하였다. 나아가, 도출된 결과를 인지된 진정성과 기만으로 그룹을 구분해 인식의 차이가 이에 따라 드러나는지 추가적으로 살펴보았다. 연구 결과, AI가 생성한 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 만족도에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았으나, 뉴스로 대표되는 실용적 콘텐츠에서는 AI 사용에 대한 부정적 인식이 확인되었으며, 특히 뉴스 영상 제작에 있어 부정적 인식이 강하게 드러났다. 반면, 영화와 드라마로 대표되는 쾌락적 콘텐츠에서는 생성형 AI 사용에 대한 인식이 무관심하거나 오히려 긍정적이었다.

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424,","Title: Artificial intelligence in obstetrics, Abstract: This study reviews recent advances on the application of artificial intelligence for the early diagnosis of variousmaternal-fetal conditions such as preterm birth and abnormal fetal growth.

However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

This makes theoretical considerations urgent again: can this new wave of AI fare better than its precursors in emulating or even having human-like minds? I propose a cautious yet positive hypothesis: current AI might create human-like mind, but only if it incorporates certain conceptual rewiring: it needs to shift from a task-based to an agent-based framework, which can be dubbed &ldquo;Artificial Agential Intelligence&rdquo; (AAI). It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

Artificial intelligence (AI) can be used for the enhancement of a series of steps in the radiomics pipeline, from image acquisition and preprocessing, to segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and model development. The aim of this review is to present the most used AI methods for radiomics analysis, explaining the advantages and limitations of the methods. Some of the most prominent AI architectures mentioned in this review include Boruta, random forests, gradient boosting, generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and transformers. Employing these models in the process of radiomics analysis can significantly enhance the quality and effectiveness of the analysis, while addressing several limitations that can reduce the quality of predictions. Addressing these limitations can enable high quality clinical decisions and wider clinical adoption. Importantly, this review will aim to highlight how AI can assist radiomics in overcoming major bottlenecks in clinical implementation, ultimately improving the translation potential of the method., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART135159628,","Title: Artificial intelligence, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART20606948,","Title: Artificial Intelligence in Neuroimaging: Clinical Applications, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) powered by deep learning (DL) has shown remarkable progress in image recognition tasks. Over the past decade, AI has proven its feasibility for applications in medical imaging. Various aspects of clinical practice in neuroimaging can be improved with the help of AI. For example, AI can aid in detecting brain metastases, predicting treatment response of brain tumors, generating a parametric map of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and enhancing radiomics research by extracting salient features from input images. In addition, image quality can be improved via AI-based image reconstruction or motion artifact reduction.

Before his automatic writing, Yeats’s poems were mainly based on Ireland and his love, such as Irish culture and history and his love for Maud Gonne. But with automatic writing his poetics was extended into the history and culture of the world and the Universe. Moreover, Yeats and his wife’s automatic writing is similar to the condition of superintelligence. This paper compares and analyzes similarities between the Yeatses’ automatic writing and the condition of superintelligence of artificial intelligence and tries to trace and compare his ideas and the condition in his poems., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002804250,","Title: Engineering artificial intelligence, Abstract: Current Artificial Intelligence can be used to good effect in engineering systems for emulating some high-level mental functions of humans but is not suitable for coping with many other difficult tasks, especially those involving combined perception and cognition.

It focuses on enhancing understanding of the structure of artificial intelligence conscience and providing insights for future development of conscience algorithms. Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension. Although several hypertension studies using AI have been published recently, most are exploratory descriptive studies that are often difficult for clinicians to understand and have little clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a clinician-centered perspective on AI by showing recent studies on the relevance of AI for patients with hypertension. The review is organized into sections on blood pressure measurement and hypertension diagnosis, prognosis, and management.

More so, artificial intelligence is gaining wide adoption as it aims to enhance the learning outcomes of students. The purpose of the current research paper was to find out the best artificial intelligence tools for undergraduate students that may be used to enhance their learning results and also discover what students use AI tools for. Method: The purpose was achieved by adopting a survey design to collect data that was analyzed statistically using percentages and pie charts. Findings: The study found out that undergraduate students use ChatGPT, Grammarly, Meta AI, ELSA Speak, Notion AI, BlackBox, Tome.APP, Tabnine, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, AI Notes, Phatomath, Midjourney, StarryAI, Murf, Runway, Copy.AI, Durable or Soundful in their learning process. Such AI tools help them gain a better understanding of the topics related to their study, do assignments, create content faster, write a certain piece of content, get feedback on a given content, and do its translation. The AI tools also organize tasks, review answers, and instruct how to go about answering given tasks. Conclusion and Recommendation: The use of numerous AI tools by undergraduate students enhances learning. The upscaling of AI tool usage requires universities to focus their efforts on integrating AI into their curricula and offering regular training sessions, and workshops. They should also foster continuous research and development in AI and continuous monitoring and evaluation of AI tools and their impact on the performances of students., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202510536006489,","Title: Artificial intelligence, Abstract: AbstractArtificial intelligence (AI) is the Science and Engineering domain concerned with the theory and practice of developing systems that exhibit the characteristics we associate with intelligence in human behavior.

Responses of living cells to their environment suggest that they possess some &ldquo;innate intelligence&rdquo;. Such responses have been modeled by a cybernetic approach. Furthermore, the overall behavior of a bioreactor containing a population of cells may be described and controlled through artificial intelligence methods. Therefore, it seems logical to combine cybernetic models with artificial intelligence to evolve an integrated intelligence-based strategy that is physiologically more faithful than the current approaches. This possibility is discussed, together with practical considerations favoring a hybrid approach that includes some mathematical modeling., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART27398607,","Title: Classification of Beef by Using Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This paper aims to develop an application that classifies the quality of beef via Artificial Intelligence technology, which has experienced rapid technological growth in recent years. The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts. However, it worked poor for other beef cuts. This is simply a learning problem for image classifiers., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117816967,","Title: Artificial intelligence and robotics, Abstract: Since Robotics is the field concerned with the connection of perception to action, Artificial Intelligence must have a central role in Robotics if the connection is to be intelligent. Artificial Intelligence addresses the crucial questions of: what knowledge is required in any aspect of thinking; how should that knowledge be represented; and how should that knowledge be used. Robotics challenges AI by forcing it to deal with real objects in the real world. Techniques and representations developed for purely cognitive problems, often in toy domains, do not necessarily extend to meet the challenge. Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects. Such reasoning concerns space, path-planning, uncertainty, and compliance. We conclude with three examples that illustrate the kinds of reasoning or problem-solving abilities we would like to endow robots with and that we believe are worthy goals of both Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, being within reach of both., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART16323871,","Title: Digital Skills, Transmedia, and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: Communication has been the basis for “key competencies” in every period of history. In the digital age, these competencies cross over lines of disciplines, modalities, approaches, media, and platforms. This paper shows the evolution of communicative competences, and explores the ramifications of the fourth industrial revolution, also known as Industry 4.0, for teaching and learning. In this revolutionary era, transmedia connects directly with changing educational needs, not only to help students learn to use tools driven by artificial intelligence, but to live in a world where we will be communicating with these agents in hybrid communities that include human and digital agents alike. The author approaches the role of the teacher in guiding students through this complex learning space, where plurilingualism and interculturality are prerequisites for success, and offers two simple activities that are easy to reproduce in the classroom that call upon emerging technologies. The activities present different learning situations that integrate reflection about technology and society while building language competencies.

구성주의 관점에서 인공지능 연구가 확장한 지능 이해의 지평과 주요 기술 동향

##서론##
구성주의는 데카르트의 이성주의적 인간 이해에 대한 반성에서 출발하여 지능을 포함한 인간 이해의 새로운 대안을 제시하는 철학적 관점입니다. 인공지능(AI) 연구는 이러한 구성주의적 관점을 통해 지능에 대한 이해의 지평을 넓히고 있으며, 이는 진화생물학, 진화심리학, 뇌과학, 시스템 이론, 복잡계 이론 등 다양한 학문 분야의 성과와도 설명을 공유합니다 (JAKO200430710415942). 본 글에서는 구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능 연구가 지능 이해의 지평을 어떻게 확장했으며, 이와 관련된 주요 기술 동향은 무엇인지 요약하고자 합니다.

##본론##
###1. 지능 이해의 지평 확장
구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능 연구는 지능을 단순히 계산 능력이나 문제 해결 능력으로만 보는 것을 넘어, 다음과 같은 방향으로 이해의 지평을 확장하고 있습니다.

*   **보편지능(General Intelligence)의 추구**: 인공지능 분야에서 구성주의적 방법론은 보편지능(general intelligence, AGI)의 토대를 마련하는 데 기여합니다. 이는 여러 관점의 마음에 대한 이론과 기술을 상호보완적으로 이해하려는 시도와 연결되며, 제한된 인공 협소 지능(ANI)을 넘어 인간과 유사한 일반 지능을 목표로 합니다 (JAKO200430710415942, NART118861015).
*   **인간 지능의 다면적 이해와 모의**: AI 연구는 인간 지능을 어떻게 파악하고 있는지, 지능과 뇌의 관계가 무엇인지, 그리고 이를 컴퓨터를 통해 모의하고 복제하는 논리적 구조에 대한 이해를 심화시키는 중요한 철학적 문제로 접근합니다 (JAKO198911920276086). 또한, AI가 지각 및 인지 측면에서 인간 경험을 어떻게 매개하고 변화시키는지, 그리고 AI가 의도적인 행위자로 이해될 수 있는지에 대한 현상학적 담론을 통해 지능의 존재론적 의미를 탐구합니다 (ART003234872).
*   **사회적 구성으로서의 지능 인식**: 인공지능의 발달 과정은 AI 기술 특허와 뉴스 보도 프레임이 미디어 담론의 결정요인에 의해 사회적으로 구성되는 양상을 보여줍니다. 이는 지능이 단순히 기술적 산물이 아닌 사회문화적 맥락에서 이해되어야 함을 시사하며, AI가 인간과 세상 사이의 중재자 역할을 하며 지각, 지식, 의사 결정에 영향을 미친다는 점을 강조합니다 (JAKO202022560454968, ART003234872).

###2. 주요 기술 동향
구성주의적 지능 이해와 관련된 인공지능 연구의 주요 기술 동향은 다음과 같습니다.

*   **자율성장 및 뇌 모사 인공지능 기술**: 미래 인공지능 경쟁력의 핵심 요소로 자동 데이터 증강 및 효율적인 소규모 데이터 학습 알고리즘이 강조됩니다. 또한, 인간의 뇌 지식 처리 방식을 모방한 신경 기억 모델 개발을 통해 양상 협력 학습(modality cooperative learning)을 통한 지식 확장 및 인간과의 상호작용을 통한 선언적/절차적 지식의 자율적 개발이 추진됩니다 (JAKO201962652079520). 이는 다차원 신경망, 임시 및 장기 기억, 감각 및 운동 시스템, 동기 부여, 목적 지향적 행동, 사고, 의식, 무의식, 인공 인격 개발 등을 포함하는 생체 모방적 접근 방식을 기반으로 합니다 (NPAP11735379, JAKO202157242317905).
*   **생성형 AI 및 일반 인공지능(AGI)으로의 발전**: ChatGPT와 같은 생성형 AI의 폭발적인 성장은 다양한 형태의 데이터를 생성하며, 학습되지 않은 사항도 사람처럼 스스로 판단하여 처리하는 일반 인공지능(AGI)으로의 확장을 목표로 합니다. 이는 AI가 단순한 도구를 넘어 자율적이고 해석적으로 작동하는 행위자로 진화하고 있음을 보여줍니다 (JAKO202424843343292, ART003234872).
*   **도메인 지식의 통합 및 융합 학습**: 딥러닝 시대에도 도메인 지식의 중요성이 여전히 강조되며, 이는 인공지능이 특정 분야의 전문 지식을 통합하여 더 정교한 지능을 구성하는 방향으로 발전하고 있음을 나타냅니다 (ART002675389). 또한, 인공지능 기술은 유비쿼터스 학습 환경에서 상황 인지(Context-Awareness)를 기반으로 지능을 개념화하는 등 다양한 분야와의 융합을 통해 지능의 이해를 확장합니다 (JAKO201232073078148).
*   **인공지능 윤리 및 거버넌스 기술**: 인공지능 기술의 발전과 함께 윤리적 고려사항이 중요해지면서, AI 시스템의 안전성, 신뢰성, 공정성, 책임성, 투명성 등을 보장하기 위한 기술 표준 및 거버넌스 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있습니다. 이는 지능 개발이 기술적 측면뿐만 아니라 사회적, 윤리적 측면을 포괄하는 구성주의적 접근을 요구함을 보여줍니다 (JAKO202470953313989, JAKO202207750091254, JAKO202412343246540).

##결론##
구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능 연구는 지능을 데카르트적 이성주의를 넘어선 다학제적이고 상호보완적인 개념으로 확장하고 있습니다. 이는 보편지능의 추구, 인간 지능의 다면적 이해, 그리고 사회적 구성으로서의 지능 인식을 포함합니다. 기술 동향으로는 인간 뇌를 모사한 자율성장 신경망 모델, 생성형 AI를 통한 AGI로의 발전, 도메인 지식의 통합, 그리고 윤리적이고 책임감 있는 AI 개발을 위한 거버넌스 및 안전성 기술 연구가 두드러집니다. 이러한 접근은 인공지능이 단순한 도구를 넘어 인간과 상호작용하며 지식을 구성하고 진화하는 복합적인 시스템으로 발전하고 있음을 시사하며, 인공지능의 잠재력을 최대한 활용하면서도 그 위험을 관리하기 위한 다각적인 노력이 필요함을 강조합니다.",0.6758
"컴퓨터과학자들이 제안한 인공지능 정의에 내재된 지능, 뇌, 그리고 컴퓨터 모의 사이의 논쟁적 쟁점을 어떻게 요약할 수 있나요?","##제목## 인공지능 정의에 담긴 지능·뇌·컴퓨터 모의의 핵심 논쟁 ##서론## 인공지능 연구에서 지능, 뇌, 그리고 컴퓨터 모의 사이의 관계를 어떻게 설정하느냐는 정의 자체의 방향을 가르는 중요한 쟁점이다. AI 연구자들은 인간 지능의 본질을 과학적으로 분석하면서 동시에 이를 컴퓨터 시스템으로 구현·복제하려는 목표를 공유한다. 이 과정에서 드러나는 주요 논쟁은 경험적 기술 발전의 문제를 넘어 논리적·개념적 선험성에 관한 것이다. ##본론## 1. 지능의 개념화: - 일부 정의는 지능을 문제 해결 능력이나 정보처리 효율로 환원하지만, 다른 입장에서는 창의성·맥락 이해 등 비계산적 요소를 강조한다. - 이처럼 지능의 범위를 어떻게 설정하느냐에 따라 AI 목표와 평가 기준이 달라진다. 2. 지능과 뇌의 관계: - 기계적 모의가 가능한가라는 물음은 뇌의 기능을 얼마나 정밀하게 수학·논리 모델로 환원할 수 있는지와 직결된다. - 신경망, 복잡계 이론 등 뇌과학 성과를 차용한 접근이 존재하지만, 생물학적 뇌가 지니는 비선형·동적 특성을 모두 모방하기에는 한계가 명확하다. 3. 컴퓨터 모의의 논리 구조: - 컴퓨터 시뮬레이션은 기호 처리(symbolic processing)와 계산 모델에 기반하지만, 이론적 비판론자들은 의미 부여·상향식 학습 등을 처리하지 못한다고 지적한다. - 따라서 AI 정의는 기술적 능력과 더불어 개념적 명료성, 즉 어떤 ‘지능’을 왜·어떻게 모의하는지에 대한 논리적 근거 확보가 필수적이다. 4. 경험적 진보 vs 선험적 분석: - 하드웨어·알고리즘 발전이 보여주는 성과에도 불구하고, AI 탐구의 핵심은 개념·논리적 쟁점에 대한 선험적 고찰에서 비롯된다. - 지능과 뇌, 그리고 컴퓨터 모의 간의 논의를 명확히 구축해야만 지속 가능한 이론적 토대를 마련할 수 있다. ##결론## 인공지능의 정의를 둘러싼 논쟁은 기술적 성취를 넘어 지능의 본질과 뇌 모사의 논리적 근거를 엄밀히 따지는 개념적 과제를 요구한다. 이를 통해 AI 연구는 단순 시뮬레이션 수준을 넘어, 인간 지능의 다양한 특성을 정교하게 반영하고 설명할 수 있는 방향으로 진화할 수 있다.","How can you summarize the controversial issue between intelligence, brain, and computer simulation inherent in the definition of artificial intelligence proposed by computer scientists?","##title## Intelligence, brain, and computer mock core arguments contained in artificial intelligence definition ##introduction## How to set up the relationship between intelligence, brain, and computer mock in AI research is an important issue that divides the direction of the definition itself. AI researchers scientifically analyze the essence of human intelligence and at the same time share their goals to implement and replicate them with their computer systems. The main debate revealed in this process is to go beyond the problem of empirical technology and relate to logical and conceptual priorities. ## Main ## 1. Conceptualization of Intelligence: Some definitions reduce intelligence with problem -solving ability or information processing efficiency, but other perspectives emphasize non -calculated factors such as creativity and context. -The AI goal and evaluation criteria depend on how to set the scope of intelligence. 2. The relationship between intelligence and brain: The question of whether mechanical simulation is possible is directly related to how precisely the brain's function can be reduced to mathematics and logical models. Although there are approaches to brain science, such as neural networks and complex theory, there is a clear limit to imitating all nonlinear and dynamic characteristics of biological brain. 3. Computer mock logic structure: Computer simulations are based on symbolic processing and calculation models, but theoretical criticisms point out that they do not process meaning and bottom -up learning. Therefore, AI definition is essential to secure a logical basis for the technical ability, the conceptual clarity, that is, what kind of intelligence, and how to simulate what intelligence. 4. Empirical Progress vs priority analysis: Despite the achievements of the development of hardware and algorithms, the core of the AI exploration comes from a priori consideration of concept and logical issues. -The discussion between intelligence, brain, and computer mocks can be clearly established to lay the foundation for sustainable theoretical theoretical theoretical theoretical. ##conclusion## The debate over the definition of artificial intelligence goes beyond technical achievements and requires a conceptual task that strictly determines the essence of intelligence and the logical basis of brain simulation. Through this, AI research can go beyond simple simulation levels, and evolve in a way that can be delicately reflected and explained the various characteristics of human intelligence.","Title: 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)과 대학수학교육, Abstract: 첨단 정보통신기술(ICT)인 인공지능(AI), 사물인터넷(IoT), 빅데이터(Big Data) 등이 사회와 경제 전반에 융합돼 혁신적인 변화가 일어나는 요즘, 헬스케어, 지능형 로봇, 가정용 인공지능 시스템(스마트홈), 공유자동차 등은 이미 우리 생활에 깊이 영향을 미치고 있다. 이미 오래전부터 공장에서는 로봇이 사람 대신 일을 하고 있으며(FA, OA), 인공지능 의사도 병원에서 활동을 하고 있고(Dr. Watson), 인공지능 스피커(기가지니)와 인공지능 비서인 구글 어시스턴트가 자연어생성을 하며 우리를 돕고 있다. 이제 인공지능을 이해하는 것은 필수가 되었으며, 인공지능을 이해하기 위해서 수학의 지식은 선택이 아니라 필수가 되었다. 따라서 이런 일들을 가능하게 해주는 수학지식을 설명하는 역할이 수학자들에게 주어졌다. 이에 본 연구진은 인공지능과 머신러닝(Machine Learning, 기계학습)을 이해하기 위해 필요한 수학 개념을 우리의 실정에 맞게 한 학기(또는 두 학기) 분량으로 정리하여, 무료 전자교과서 '인공지능을 위한 기초수학'을 집필하고, 인공지능 분야에 관심이 있는 다양한 전공의 대학생과 대학원생을 대상으로 하는 강좌를 개설하였다. 본 논문에서는 그 개발과정과 운영사례를 공유한다. http://matrix.skku.ac.kr/math4ai/, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202014151762669,","Title: 초등 인공지능 교육을 위한 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미 연구, Abstract: 본 연구는 문헌 연구 통해 설명 가능한 인공지능의 개념과 문제해결과정을 탐구하였다. 본 연구를 통하여 설명 가능한 인공지능의 교육적 의미와 적용 방안을 제시하였다. 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이란 인간과 관련된 인공지능 문제를 다루는 사람 중심의 인공지능 교육으로 학생들은 문제 해결 능력을 함양할 수 있다. 그리고, 알고리즘 교육을 통해 인공지능의 원리를 이해하고 실생활 문제 상황과 관련된 인공지능 모델을 설명하며 인공지능의 활용분야까지 확장할 수 있다. 이러한 설명 가능한 인공지능 교육이 초등학교에서 적용되기 위해서는 실제 삶과 관련된 예를 사용해야 하며 알고리즘 자체가 해석력을 지닌 것을 활용하는 것이 좋다. 또한, 이해가 설명으로 나아가기 위해 다양한 교수학습방법 및 도구를 활용해야 한다. 2022년 개정 교육과정에서 인공지능 도입을 앞두고 본 연구가 실제 수업을 위한 기반으로써 의미 있게 활용되기를 바란다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202132238500768,","Title: 구성적 인공지능, Abstract: 서양철학의 근간을 이루는 데카르트의 이성주의적 인간이해의 반성으로부터 등장한 구성주의는 지능을 포함한 인간이해의 새로운 대안이 될 수 있을 것으로 생각한다. 구성주의는 진화생물학, 진화심리학, 뇌과학, 시스템이론, 복잡계 이론의 성과뿐만 아니라 나아가 인문사회학의 경향과도 설명을 공유할 수 있는 많은 부분이 있다. 또한 인공지능 분야에서도 구성주의적 방법이라고 할 수 있는 연구가 진행되고 있다. 이 글에서는 구성주의적 관점에서 인공지능에서 다루는 지능에 대한 이해의 지평을 넓히고 이를 기반으로 한 방법론에 대한 검토와 그러한 경향에 있는 일부 인공지능 기술을 살펴보고자 한다. 이러한 논의를 통하여 여러 가지 관점의 마음에 대한 이론과 기술을 상호보완적으로 이해하고 다소 등한히 되고 있는 인공지능의 보편지능(general intelligence)의 토대로 삼고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO200430710415942,","Title: 마음,지능,인공지능, Abstract: 최근 여러 학문 분야에서는 논의되고 있는 인공지능(AI)의 문제는 과학적 문제임과 동시에 중요한 철학적 문제이다.본고는 컴퓨터과학자 혹은 인지과학자들이 내리고 있는 AI의 정의들을 분석함으로써 그 속에 함축되어 있는 논쟁점들을 발굴하고,관련된 논변들을 검토함 으로써 AI탐구가 지니는 의의를 명확히 해보려는 데 그 목적이 있다.AI에 대한 정의들은 AI연구가들의 관심과 목표 그리고 그 주장의 강도에 따라 여러 유형으로 분류될 수 있지만 대개가 인간지능을 어떻게 파악하고 있는지,지능과 뇌의 관계가 무엇인지,그리고 그것을 컴퓨터를 통해서 모의하고 복제한다는 것의 논리적 구조가 무엇인지에 대한 이해와 밀접한 관계가 있다.이점에서 AI연구에 있어서 관건이 되는 것은 컴퓨터 기술의 발전과 같은 경험상의 문제라기 보다는 오히려 논리나 개념분석과 같은 선험적인 문제와 밀접하게 연관되어 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO198911920276086,","Title: 인공지능 생성 콘텐츠(Artificial Intelligence Generated Content)와 인공지능 사용 공개(Artificial Intelligence Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자 인식 연구: 콘텐츠 가치와 형식을 중심으로, Abstract: 최근 생성형 인공지능(Artificial Intelligence)은 다양한 형식의 미디어를 포함하여 자율적으로 콘텐츠를 생성할 수 있는 능력으로 주목받고 있다. 그 잠재력에도 불구하고 AI가 생성한 콘텐츠(AI-Generated Content, AIGC)의 진정성(Authenticity) 이슈가 제기됨에 따라 각국에서 AI 사용과 투명성에 대한 규제가 수립되고 있다. 하지만, AIGC와 AI 사용 공개(AI Disclaimer)에 대한 소비자의 이해라는 근본적인 주제는 여전히 탐색되지 않고 있다. 본 연구는 생성형 AI가 제작한 콘텐츠를 실용적, 쾌락적 가치유형으로 구분하고 각각 글, 사진, 영상의 미디어 형식을 적용한 6가지의 경우에 대한 소비자의 인식을 카노 모형을 통해 분석하였다. 나아가, 도출된 결과를 인지된 진정성과 기만으로 그룹을 구분해 인식의 차이가 이에 따라 드러나는지 추가적으로 살펴보았다. 연구 결과, AI가 생성한 콘텐츠에 대한 소비자 인식은 만족도에 큰 영향을 미치지 않았으나, 뉴스로 대표되는 실용적 콘텐츠에서는 AI 사용에 대한 부정적 인식이 확인되었으며, 특히 뉴스 영상 제작에 있어 부정적 인식이 강하게 드러났다. 반면, 영화와 드라마로 대표되는 쾌락적 콘텐츠에서는 생성형 AI 사용에 대한 인식이 무관심하거나 오히려 긍정적이었다.

Recently, we propose TurKontrol, a theoretical model based on POMDPs to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. However, they neither describe how to learn the model parameters, nor show its effectiveness in a real crowd-sourced setting. Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140,","Title: Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective, Abstract: AbstractIn recent years, various studies have highlighted the opportunities of artificial intelligence (AI) for our society. For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122671508,","Title: The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth, Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth.

In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies.

Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations?

It comprises practical reason (McDowell, J. [1979] Virtue and reason, Monist62(3), 331-350; McDowell, J.

Method This study examines in detail the academic concepts and structural properties of conscience. Reviewing the academic literature and the latest data, we propose the structure of artificial intelligence conscience. Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924,","Title: Measuring Intelligence in Natural and Artificial Systems, Abstract: A systematic understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness can only be achieved when we can accurately measure intelligence and consciousness. In other work, I have suggested how the measurement of consciousness can be improved by reframing the science of consciousness as a search for mathematical theories that map between physical and conscious states. This paper discusses the measurement of intelligence in natural and artificial systems. While reasonable methods exist for measuring intelligence in humans, these can only be partly generalized to non-human animals and they cannot be applied to artificial systems. Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety. , Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671,","Title: Logic and artificial intelligence, Abstract: The theoretical foundations of the logical approach to artificial intelligence are presented.

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension.

The application will allow users to obtain information including, but not limited to, cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef they are about to purchase. Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef. Also, Flask web server is used to apply the client-server structure. The developed system worked well for tenderloin, sirloin, and ribs. It provided high confidence over 75% for these cuts.

Robots combine mechanical effectors, sensors, and computers. AI has made significant contributions to each component. We review AI contributions to perception and reasoning about physical objects.

##서론##
컴퓨터과학자 및 인지과학자들이 인공지능(AI)을 정의하는 과정에서 '지능', '뇌', 그리고 '컴퓨터 모의'는 핵심적인 논쟁적 쟁점들을 내포하고 있습니다. 이들 정의는 인간 지능을 어떻게 이해하고, 지능과 뇌의 관계를 어떻게 설정하며, 이를 컴퓨터로 모의하고 복제하는 것의 논리적 구조가 무엇인지에 대한 근본적인 질문과 밀접하게 연관되어 있습니다. 이러한 쟁점들은 단순히 기술 발전의 문제를 넘어 철학적, 선험적인 문제로 다루어지고 있습니다.

##본론##
컴퓨터과학자들이 제안하는 인공지능 정의에 내재된 지능, 뇌, 컴퓨터 모의 사이의 논쟁적 쟁점들은 다음과 같이 요약할 수 있습니다.

1.  **지능(Intelligence)의 본질과 범위에 대한 논쟁:**
    *   **인간 지능의 이해와 모방 가능성:** 인공지능 연구자들은 인간 지능을 어떻게 파악하고, 이를 어느 정도까지 인공적으로 구현할 수 있는지에 대해 다양한 관점을 가집니다. 일부는 인간과 유사하게 사고하고 이해하는 컴퓨터 시스템을 AI의 개념으로 보지만, 다른 이들은 인공지능이 인간의 주관적 의식이나 감성적 측면까지 가질 수 있는지에 대해 회의적입니다. 특히, 튜링과 써얼의 논의에서 컴퓨터의 이해 능력에 대한 인정과 부인은 지능의 본질에 대한 깊은 철학적 질문을 제기합니다.
    *   **보편 지능(General Intelligence)의 목표:** 인공지능 연구의 궁극적인 목표 중 하나는 인간 수준의 보편 지능(AGI)을 재현하는 것이지만, 현재까지는 특정 문제 해결에 특화된 좁은 인공지능(ANI)의 범주를 넘어서는 것으로 인식됩니다. 보편 지능의 정의와 구현 가능성 자체가 논쟁의 대상입니다.
    *   **지능의 구성주의적 관점:** 데카르트의 이성주의적 인간 이해에 대한 반성으로 등장한 구성주의는 지능을 포함한 인간 이해의 새로운 대안을 제시하며, 인공지능 분야에서도 구성주의적 방법론을 통해 지능에 대한 이해의 지평을 넓히려는 시도가 있습니다. 이는 지능이 단순히 고정된 실체가 아니라 상호작용을 통해 구성되는 것일 수 있다는 관점을 제시합니다.

2.  **뇌(Brain)의 역할과 모방 가능성에 대한 논쟁:**
    *   **지능과 뇌의 관계:** 인공지능 정의에서 지능이 뇌와 어떤 관계를 가지는지에 대한 이해는 중요한 논쟁점입니다. 뇌과학(신경과학)은 오랫동안 인공지능 연구에 영감을 주었으며, 초기 AI 모델에 깊은 영향을 미쳤습니다.
    *   **뇌 모사(Brain Mimicry)의 한계와 필요성:** 인간의 뇌를 모방하여 인공지능을 구현하려는 시도(예: 인공 신경망, 뉴럴링크, 커넥톰 기반 네트워크)가 활발하지만, 최근 딥러닝의 발전은 뇌과학적 영감보다는 정교한 수학적 방법과 컴퓨팅 파워에 더 크게 의존하고 있습니다. 그러나 AI의 불투명성, 상식 부족, 협소성 등의 주요 한계를 해결하기 위해 다시 뇌과학에서 통찰과 영감을 얻으려는 움직임이 있습니다. 이는 뇌의 생물학적 메커니즘을 얼마나, 어떻게 모방해야 진정한 지능에 도달할 수 있는지에 대한 논쟁을 야기합니다.
    *   **인간-AI 융합의 윤리적 쟁점:** 뇌 연구를 컴퓨터 과학에 접목하여 인간처럼 생각하는 지능을 구현하려는 뉴럴링크와 같은 시도는 AI가 인간 외부에 존재하는 것을 넘어 인간 내부에 구현되는 또 다른 현실로 확장될 가능성을 제시하며, 이는 인간 또는 인간과 연결된 AI에 대한 윤리적 문제로 이어집니다.

3.  **컴퓨터 모의(Computer Simulation)의 진정한 지능 구현 가능성에 대한 논쟁:**
    *   **모의의 논리적 구조와 한계:** 컴퓨터를 통해 지능을 모의하고 복제하는 것의 논리적 구조에 대한 이해는 인공지능 연구의 관건으로, 이는 컴퓨터 기술 발전과 같은 경험상의 문제라기보다는 논리나 개념 분석과 같은 선험적인 문제와 밀접하게 연관되어 있습니다. 컴퓨터가 인간의 사고와 이해를 단순히 흉내 내는 것인지, 아니면 진정으로 그러한 능력을 갖출 수 있는지에 대한 근본적인 질문이 존재합니다.
    *   **주관적 의식의 문제:** 컴퓨터 모의가 인간의 주관적 의식을 구현할 수 있는가 하는 문제는 인공지능의 진정한 이해 능력에 대한 가장 큰 논쟁점 중 하나입니다. 언어를 가진 인간이 신체와 의식의 통일체로서 인격의 징표로 작용하는 주관적 의식을 컴퓨터가 가질 수 있는지에 대한 의문이 제기됩니다.
    *   **자율적 행위자로서의 AI:** AI 시스템이 단순한 도구를 넘어 자율적이고 해석적인 행위자로 기능할 수 있는지에 대한 논의는 컴퓨터 모의가 단순한 계산을 넘어선 진정한 지능을 구현할 수 있는가에 대한 질문과 연결됩니다.

##결론##
컴퓨터과학자들이 인공지능을 정의할 때, 지능의 본질과 범위, 뇌의 역할과 모방 가능성, 그리고 컴퓨터 모의가 진정한 지능을 구현할 수 있는지에 대한 깊은 논쟁적 쟁점들이 존재합니다. 이러한 쟁점들은 인간 지능의 복잡성을 이해하고, 생물학적 뇌의 메커니즘을 인공 시스템에 어떻게 적용할지, 그리고 컴퓨터가 단순한 모의를 넘어선 자율적이고 의식적인 존재가 될 수 있는지에 대한 근본적인 질문을 던지며, 인공지능 연구의 철학적, 윤리적, 기술적 방향성을 결정하는 데 중요한 영향을 미치고 있습니다.",0.6758
"How would you summarize the proposed enabling framework for achieving the second Sustainable Development Goal, emphasizing the role of data sharing and near real-time analytics?","##Enabling Data-Driven Framework for SDG2## ##Introduction## This framework addresses the urgent goal of eradicating hunger and securing safe, nutritious food for all by outlining a connected platform that spans the entire food network. It builds on the Sustainable Development Solutions Network’s recommendation for a generic enabling mechanism adaptable to any country’s development status. ##Main Body## At its core, the framework establishes clear information flows and feedback loops among farmers, suppliers, policymakers, researchers, and consumers to coordinate interventions across production, distribution, and consumption. Free exchange of data—ranging from crop yields and market prices to nutritional indicators—is coupled with near real-time analytics to detect emerging risks, optimize resource allocation, and guide policy decisions. The incorporation of IoT sensors and Big Data technologies ensures continuous monitoring of environmental conditions, supply chain performance, and food safety metrics.

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment.

We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions.

Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry.

Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

We first discuss the sources and characteristics of energy big data. Also, a process model of big data driven smart energy management is proposed. Then taking smart grid as the research background, we provide a systematic review of big data analytics for smart energy management. It is discussed from four major aspects, namely power generation side management, microgrid and renewable energy management, asset management and collaborative operation, as well as demand side management (DSM). Afterwards, the industrial development of big data-driven smart energy management is analyzed and discussed. Finally, we point out the challenges of big data-driven smart energy management in IT infrastructure, data collection and governance, data integration and sharing, processing and analysis, security and privacy, and professionals., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74782503,","Title: Nursing Needs Big Data and Big Data Needs Nursing, Abstract: AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76701778,","Title: Optimized Data Processing Analysis Using Big Data Cloud Platform, Abstract: Recently data processing has main gained many attention both from academic and commercial industry. Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002687869,","Title: Big Data in Building Energy Efficiency: Understanding of Big Data and Main Challenges, Abstract: Data generation has increased drastically over the past few years.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12215719,","Title: Big Data Smoothing and Outlier Removal for Patent Big Data Analysis, Abstract: In general statistical analysis, we need to make a normal assumption. If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201626360541485,","Title: Big Data ethics, Abstract: The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects. We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data.

This development intensifies the information asymmetry between the dominant and vulnerable parties, posing increasing challenges for consumers and the entirety of European contract law. This paper offers three main contributions to this discourse. First, the utilization of big data introduces a novel form of information asymmetry between contracting parties, further empowering the already dominant party while exacerbating the vulnerability of the weaker party. Second, contemporary European case law and legal scholarship advocate for a harmonious approach in which European regulations and national remedies complement one another in protecting individuals. Lastly, there are already instances indicating the misuse of big data, where multiple individual claims may arise at both European and national levels., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132663034,","Title: Big data? Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR, Abstract: Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112101193,","Title: &#x201e;Massendinghaltung“ oder &#x201e;Big Data“?, Abstract: SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage.

Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0.

However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy.

##Introduction##
The proposed enabling framework for achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including the second goal (Zero Hunger), heavily relies on technological upgrading through the adoption of innovative technologies, particularly big data analytics (BDA). This framework is designed to address societal challenges and foster value creation by leveraging advanced data capabilities. A key aspect of this framework is the strategic integration of robust data sharing mechanisms and efficient near real-time analytics.

##Main Body##
The core of this enabling framework is a technology-organization-environment approach that facilitates the adoption of big data analytics for realizing SDGs. This involves top management support and a focus on data-driven decision-making.

**Role of Data Sharing:**
Data sharing is a critical component of this framework, aiming to establish a ""circular system"" for information utilization. This involves:
*   **Systematic Storage and Efficient Access:** Implementing systems that can systematically store, efficiently search, and share diverse information, such as defect information in construction using Linked Data technology and Building Information Modeling (BIM).
*   **Addressing Data Challenges in Smart Cities:** For sustainable urban development, frameworks like the ""Deep Learning City Framework"" are proposed to overcome data sharing and service compatibility issues. This includes securely sharing spatiotemporal data across urban areas and fusing learning data from multiple cities. Similarly, a ""Geospatial Information Standard-based Smart City (SCGI) framework"" emphasizes standardized geospatial information and collaboration among stakeholders.
*   **Data Governance:** Establishing comprehensive big data governance models is essential. These models ensure data quality, protect privacy, manage the data lifecycle, and clarify data ownership and management rights through dedicated organizational structures.
*   **Leveraging Crowdsourcing and Public Platforms:** Crowdsourcing can enhance the value of satellite data by providing human resources for processing and supplying complementary data, including collection and monitoring functions. Public big data platforms are designed with data share channels to facilitate contributions from data providers and utilization by users.
*   **Ethical Considerations and Legal Basis:** Ethical frameworks are crucial to ensure secure data access and mitigate disclosure risks when dealing with sensitive big data. Furthermore, a proper legal basis is necessary to promote the beneficial use of big data while preventing its misuse. MyData initiatives empower individuals with data sovereignty, with MyData operators supporting personal data management and sharing within business ecosystems.

**Role of Near Real-time Analytics:**
Near real-time analytics is fundamental for transforming raw data into actionable insights swiftly, enabling timely interventions and informed decision-making for sustainable development. This includes:
*   **Real-time Processing of Streaming Data:** The framework emphasizes open data frameworks for real-time processing and analysis of streaming big data. Technologies like NiFi, Kafka, and Druid are utilized to rapidly process and analyze large-scale, real-time data, providing constantly updated information for various services, such as e-Navigation.
*   **Spatiotemporal Data Management:** Spatiotemporal database systems are vital for effectively storing and rapidly searching real-time location information of dynamic objects, which is crucial for applications like disaster monitoring and smart city management.
*   **Temporal Data Mining:** Temporal data mining frameworks are employed to explore useful temporal knowledge, including periodic patterns, calendar patterns, and trends, from large datasets with time values.
*   **Rapid Risk Analysis and Prediction:** Big data-based frameworks enable detailed and extensive analysis of disaster risk by processing large volumes of data in a short time through distributed and parallel processing. This supports accurate judgment and effective response during disaster situations. In manufacturing, real-time quality prediction is supported by data processing architecture frameworks.
*   **Advanced Analytics for Specific Domains:** Deep awareness frameworks are effective for real-time context-awareness in pervasive video clouds, combining historical and current views with deep learning techniques. In disaster monitoring, satellite image-AI based systems are being developed for feasible near real-time integrated monitoring.

##Conclusion##
In summary, the proposed enabling framework for achieving Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG2, is built upon the robust adoption of big data analytics. This framework critically integrates comprehensive data sharing mechanisms to ensure data accessibility, quality, and ethical use, alongside advanced near real-time analytics capabilities. These analytical tools enable rapid processing of vast and dynamic datasets, facilitating timely insights and adaptive decision-making across various sectors, from agriculture and environmental management to urban planning and disaster response. By fostering a collaborative and technologically advanced data ecosystem, this framework aims to drive sustainable development and address complex global challenges effectively.",0.6758
Can you outline the main advances and challenges in applying artificial intelligence and Big Data to medical imaging in neurology?,"##Artificial Intelligence and Big Data in Neurology## ##Introduction## Recent technological developments have enabled the collection and analysis of vast amounts of clinical and imaging data in neurology. These resources—including electronic health records, population registries, and advanced neuroimaging databases—offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. ##Main Body## Key advances include the deployment of machine learning models that automate lesion detection and segmentation on MRI and CT scans, improving both speed and consistency compared to manual interpretation. Deep learning frameworks have demonstrated high accuracy in classifying complex patterns associated with stroke, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease, and other conditions, leveraging convolutional neural networks trained on large annotated datasets. Integration of real-world data (RWD) and multi-modal analytics has supported the development of predictive models for disease progression and treatment response, while large-scale collaborative initiatives are standardizing data formats and promoting federated learning to protect patient privacy. Despite these successes, challenges persist: variability in image acquisition protocols compromises model generalizability, data heterogeneity and missing labels hamper robust training, and ensuring data quality and provenance remains difficult. Ethical concerns around informed consent, algorithmic bias, and data security further complicate deployment in clinical settings, and regulatory frameworks are still evolving to address accountability and transparency of AI‐driven decisions. ##Conclusion## Artificial intelligence and Big Data analytics are transforming medical imaging in neurology by enabling more accurate, efficient, and personalized care, yet overcoming data quality issues, ethical considerations, and implementation barriers is essential to fully realize their clinical potential.",없음,없음,"Title: Big data를 이용한 Warehouse Management System 모델 연구 : SAP S/4 Hana를 중심으로, Abstract: 본 연구는 오늘날 산업 전반적으로 영향을 미치고 있는 디지탈 전환(Digital Transformation)의 기술 환경과 디지탈 전환의 산업적 창고관리 부분의 모델연구가 본 논문의 목적이다. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 디지털 전환은 오랫동안 디지털화와 비슷하거나 또는 디지털 방식으로 저장할 수 있도록 기존 데이터 형태를 전환하는 것과 관련이 있다. 물론 이 점이 중요하긴 하지만, 이전의 디지털화는 최신 디지털 전환의 영역을 포함하지 않았었다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 특히 이번 연구에서는 Big Data를 중심으로 Warehouse Management System의 방향을 제시 하고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015305653,","Title: DTG 실 주행데이터 및 공간정보를 이용한 빅데이터 기반 연료소모량 추정 모델 연구, Abstract: 한국에서 교통사고를 줄이는 목적으로 디지털운행기록계(DTG) 장치가 모든 상용차량에 의무 장착이 되어 GPS 궤적을 포함한 많은 양의 운행기록 데이터가 생성되고 있다. 지금까지 이러한 DTG 데이터는 주로 교통안전운전을 유도하는 용도로 사용되어왔다. 그러나 DTG데이터는 연료소모량을 줄일 수 있는 에코드라이빙 분야 등 다양한 분야로 활용도를 확대할 수 있다. 본 연구는 실제 운행한 대규모 DTG운행 데이터를 공간 빅데이터 분석을 통해 연료소모량을 추정할 수 있는 모델을 수립하는 연구이다. 기존의 연료소모량 추정 모델은 주로 실험실 환경 또는 일부 지역에 국한되어 검증한 모델로 실제 운행되는 상용차량 대상으로 분석할 경우 수집하기 어려운 변수들이 많고, 한국의 전국을 운행한 다양한 운행기록 데이터를 적용하면 정확도가 낮아지는 문제점이 있다. 본 연구에서는 이러한 문제를 개선하기 위해 DTG데이터와 공간 빅데이터를 이용한 연료소모량 추정 모델인 SBiFEM(Spatial Big Data Fuel Estimation Model)을 제안하였다. SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment.

But in practice no model is ever entirely phenomenological or entirely mechanistic. We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002721909,","Title: Big Data cluster analysis, Abstract: In this paper, we focused on cluster analysis as the most commonly used technique for grouping different objects. By clustering data, we can extract groups of similar objects from different collections. First, we defined Big Data and clustering to follow the rest of the paper. We presented the most popular techniques for clustering data, including partitioning, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and network-based clustering. Big Data describes large amounts of data. High precision of big data can contribute to decision-making confidence, and better estimates can help increase efficiency, reduce costs, and risks. Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately. We described the K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering -DBSCAN algorithm, and the STING algorithm for network-based clustering., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131203869,","Title: The Big Student Big Data Grab, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART80312419,","Title: Zwangsehen und Bastarde : Wohin steuert Big Data die Wissenschaft?, Abstract: AbstractWhen the word &ldquo;science&rdquo; comes up in the context of big data, one usually thinks of scientists who make accurate predictions about future developments, events and actions by means of sophisticated analyses - or who influence behaviour with surgical precision, such as it is conveyed from Donald Trump's successful election campaign.

While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected. Hence, in this article, we present a model for supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data. This temporally hierarchical privacy-preserving model (THPPM) adapts and extends the traditional temporal hierarchy to generalize spatial data generated within a time interval with an aim to preserve privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations during some time intervals at certain geographic locations.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though.

If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization.

While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes.

This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science.

Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91115436,","Title: Big Data 2.0, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001707649,","Title: Big genetic data and its big data protection challenges, Abstract: Abstract The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0. This is an important first step and will have a significant influence on implementing the concept of big data inside the statistical offices of Germany., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74180896,","Title: Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review, Abstract: AbstractValue Chain has been considered as a key model for managing efficiently value creation processes within organizations. However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy.

##Introduction##
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Big Data into medical imaging, particularly in the field of neurology, has ushered in a new era of diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. This convergence leverages vast amounts of complex data to enhance the understanding and management of neurological conditions. However, alongside these significant advancements, several formidable challenges must be addressed to fully realize the potential of these technologies in clinical practice.

##Main Body##
###Main Advances###
The application of AI and Big Data in neurological medical imaging has led to numerous breakthroughs:

1.  **Enhanced Diagnostic Accuracy and Speed**: Deep learning techniques, especially in systems like AI PACS, significantly improve the accuracy and speed of medical image interpretation. This includes image recognition, classification, and streamlining radiological workflows.
2.  **Early and Precise Disease Detection**: AI-powered software, particularly MRI-based tools, aids in the early and accurate diagnosis of degenerative brain diseases by precisely measuring brain volume, performing segmentation, and capturing specific characteristics.
3.  **Improved Stroke Management**: Machine learning and deep learning algorithms are crucial for the timely analysis of imaging data in ischemic stroke. They assist in rapid diagnosis, acute stroke triage, identification of large vessel occlusion, prediction of stroke onset time, automated measurement of scores like ASPECTS, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcomes.
4.  **Advanced Image Quality and Analysis**: Deep learning methods are being used to enhance the quality of MR images, including noise reduction, correction of image artifacts, and improvements in image resolution, even for low-field MRI. AI also enables automated analysis of complex imaging data, such as histopathological images and EEG signals for epilepsy detection, achieving high accuracy (e.g., over 99% for epilepsy seizure detection using CNN ensemble models).
5.  **Personalized Medicine**: Big Data analytics, integrating multi-omics data, images, device data, and electronic health records, is transforming personalized medicine by guiding hypothesis formulation, generating mechanistic models, and facilitating the design of clinical procedures tailored to individual patients.
6.  **Development of Commercial AI Medical Devices**: There is a rapid increase in the development and approval of AI-based medical imaging devices, with many products receiving international certifications (e.g., FDA, CE), particularly for areas like the brain and nervous system, offering functions such as medical image analysis, detection, diagnosis assistance, and image transmission.
7.  **Multimodal Data Integration**: The emergence of generative AI and large language models capable of processing various data types simultaneously (e.g., text and images) holds significant potential for integrating diverse clinical and imaging information in neurological settings.

###Main Challenges###
Despite these advances, several challenges impede the widespread and effective application of AI and Big Data in neurological medical imaging:

1.  **Reliability, Interpretability, and Transparency (Black Box Problem)**: A major hurdle is the lack of reliability, interpretability, and transparency in many deep learning models. Their increasing complexity and non-linearity often render them ""black boxes,"" making it difficult for clinicians to understand how decisions are made, which hinders their adoption in real clinical practices. This underscores the need for Explainable AI (XAI).
2.  **Data-Related Issues**:
    *   **Inconsistent Data and Standardization**: Medical imaging data is often inconsistent and requires significant time for refinement. There is a critical need for data standardization (e.g., DICOM, R_CDM) to enable effective research and application across institutions.
    *   **Data Quality and Accessibility**: Ensuring high-quality data and improving accessibility to large, diverse medical image datasets are crucial. The availability of sufficient training examples, especially for complex analyses like digital pathology, remains a challenge.
    *   **Data Volume and Processing**: The sheer volume and complexity of neurological imaging data (e.g., gigabyte-sized pathological slides) pose significant challenges for feature extraction and processing, requiring advanced computational resources.
3.  **Ethical, Privacy, and Legal Concerns**: The use of Big Data in healthcare, particularly sensitive neurological imaging data, raises significant ethical and legal issues. These include patient privacy, data security, potential for discrimination, and the impact on the physician-patient relationship and clinical decision-making. Inadequate legal and institutional frameworks for data utilization and de-identification guidelines are also noted.
4.  **Clinical Validation and Integration**: Many AI models lack robust clinical validation, and there is difficulty in comparing the performance of different AI solutions. A lack of interoperability with existing clinical workflows and systems further complicates their integration into routine practice.
5.  **Prediction Uncertainty**: AI models still face prediction uncertainty, stemming from out-of-distribution data, aleatoric uncertainty (inherent in data), and model uncertainty. Developing independent reliability indicators and ""zero error tolerance"" models is essential for safe AI integration.
6.  **Resource and Expertise Gaps**: The effective implementation of AI and Big Data requires substantial infrastructure expansion, development of specialized analysis software, and the training of skilled personnel. Furthermore, medical professionals need additional education and revised curricula to interpret and analyze AI algorithm predictions effectively.
7.  **Loss of Contextual and Spatial Information**: Some advanced image analysis techniques, such as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) in digital pathology, may suffer from the loss of contextual and spatial information, which can impact diagnostic accuracy.

##Conclusion##
The application of AI and Big Data to medical imaging in neurology presents a landscape of remarkable progress, offering unprecedented opportunities for improving diagnostic accuracy, enabling early disease detection, enhancing image quality, and advancing personalized medicine. However, to fully harness this potential, it is imperative to overcome significant challenges related to model reliability and interpretability, data quality and standardization, ethical and privacy concerns, clinical integration, and the need for specialized infrastructure and trained professionals. Addressing these challenges through continued research, policy development, and interdisciplinary collaboration will be key to realizing a future where AI and Big Data profoundly transform neurological healthcare.",0.6758
What is the primary argument regarding the environmental impact of Big Data initiatives and the ethical considerations tied to data’s material presence?,"## Big Data, Big Waste? A Reflection on the Environmental Sustainability of Big Data Initiatives ## ## Introduction## Big Data projects often emphasize analytical capabilities while neglecting the environmental and ethical consequences of the physical infrastructures they require. Recognizing data’s materiality—servers, storage facilities, and energy consumption—is crucial to understanding the full impact of digital expansion. ## Main Body## The argument centers on three ethical concerns: first, the terminology used in data governance can obscure the environmental costs of data storage and processing; second, there is a growing tension between the rapid deployment of data centers and the goals of environmental policy aimed at reducing carbon footprints; third, unequal distribution of the ecological burdens—such as land use, energy demand, and electronic waste—raises questions of fairness and social justice. By drawing on perspectives from environmental studies and Science and Technology Studies, the authors show how the “immaterial” rhetoric of Big Data masks its concrete resource demands and spatial footprint. They advocate for a shift in governance vocabulary, alignment of data initiatives with sustainability regulations, and equitable sharing of environmental responsibilities. ## Conclusion## Acknowledging data’s physical presence and its environmental ramifications is essential for developing more sustainable, ethically informed practices in data storage, production, and governance.",없음,없음,"Title: Big data를 이용한 Warehouse Management System 모델 연구 : SAP S/4 Hana를 중심으로, Abstract: 본 연구는 오늘날 산업 전반적으로 영향을 미치고 있는 디지탈 전환(Digital Transformation)의 기술 환경과 디지탈 전환의 산업적 창고관리 부분의 모델연구가 본 논문의 목적이다. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 디지털 전환은 오랫동안 디지털화와 비슷하거나 또는 디지털 방식으로 저장할 수 있도록 기존 데이터 형태를 전환하는 것과 관련이 있다. 물론 이 점이 중요하긴 하지만, 이전의 디지털화는 최신 디지털 전환의 영역을 포함하지 않았었다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 특히 이번 연구에서는 Big Data를 중심으로 Warehouse Management System의 방향을 제시 하고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015305653,","Title: DTG 실 주행데이터 및 공간정보를 이용한 빅데이터 기반 연료소모량 추정 모델 연구, Abstract: 한국에서 교통사고를 줄이는 목적으로 디지털운행기록계(DTG) 장치가 모든 상용차량에 의무 장착이 되어 GPS 궤적을 포함한 많은 양의 운행기록 데이터가 생성되고 있다. 지금까지 이러한 DTG 데이터는 주로 교통안전운전을 유도하는 용도로 사용되어왔다. 그러나 DTG데이터는 연료소모량을 줄일 수 있는 에코드라이빙 분야 등 다양한 분야로 활용도를 확대할 수 있다. 본 연구는 실제 운행한 대규모 DTG운행 데이터를 공간 빅데이터 분석을 통해 연료소모량을 추정할 수 있는 모델을 수립하는 연구이다. 기존의 연료소모량 추정 모델은 주로 실험실 환경 또는 일부 지역에 국한되어 검증한 모델로 실제 운행되는 상용차량 대상으로 분석할 경우 수집하기 어려운 변수들이 많고, 한국의 전국을 운행한 다양한 운행기록 데이터를 적용하면 정확도가 낮아지는 문제점이 있다. 본 연구에서는 이러한 문제를 개선하기 위해 DTG데이터와 공간 빅데이터를 이용한 연료소모량 추정 모델인 SBiFEM(Spatial Big Data Fuel Estimation Model)을 제안하였다. SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment.

We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions.

Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

To fulfill the potential of energy big data and obtain insights to achieve smart energy management, we present a comprehensive study of big data driven smart energy management. We first discuss the sources and characteristics of energy big data. Also, a process model of big data driven smart energy management is proposed. Then taking smart grid as the research background, we provide a systematic review of big data analytics for smart energy management. It is discussed from four major aspects, namely power generation side management, microgrid and renewable energy management, asset management and collaborative operation, as well as demand side management (DSM). Afterwards, the industrial development of big data-driven smart energy management is analyzed and discussed. Finally, we point out the challenges of big data-driven smart energy management in IT infrastructure, data collection and governance, data integration and sharing, processing and analysis, security and privacy, and professionals., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74782503,","Title: Nursing Needs Big Data and Big Data Needs Nursing, Abstract: AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76701778,","Title: Optimized Data Processing Analysis Using Big Data Cloud Platform, Abstract: Recently data processing has main gained many attention both from academic and commercial industry. Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12215719,","Title: Big Data Smoothing and Outlier Removal for Patent Big Data Analysis, Abstract: In general statistical analysis, we need to make a normal assumption. If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201626360541485,","Title: Big Data ethics, Abstract: The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects. We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data.

This development intensifies the information asymmetry between the dominant and vulnerable parties, posing increasing challenges for consumers and the entirety of European contract law. This paper offers three main contributions to this discourse. First, the utilization of big data introduces a novel form of information asymmetry between contracting parties, further empowering the already dominant party while exacerbating the vulnerability of the weaker party. Second, contemporary European case law and legal scholarship advocate for a harmonious approach in which European regulations and national remedies complement one another in protecting individuals. Lastly, there are already instances indicating the misuse of big data, where multiple individual claims may arise at both European and national levels., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132663034,","Title: Big data? Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR, Abstract: Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112101193,","Title: &#x201e;Massendinghaltung“ oder &#x201e;Big Data“?, Abstract: SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage.

Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0.

However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy.

###Introduction###
The proliferation of Big Data initiatives, while offering significant potential for various sectors, presents a critical, yet often overlooked, dual challenge: its substantial environmental impact and the ethical considerations arising from data's inherent material presence. This issue extends beyond traditional data ethics, delving into the physical and resource-intensive nature of digital information.

###Main Body###
The primary argument regarding the environmental impact of Big Data initiatives is that these initiatives contribute significantly to environmental concerns due to the physical and material requirements of data. Data is not an abstract entity; it has a ""physical presence,"" a ""material configuration of digital service,"" and occupies ""space"" (NART103720250). This necessitates vast infrastructure for data storage and production, which consumes considerable energy and resources, leading to an environmental footprint that has largely been neglected by scholars and policymakers (NART103720250).

Tied to this material presence are crucial ethical considerations. The ""material and situated character of data raises questions concerning the ethics of the increasingly fashionable Big Data discourses"" (NART103720250). These ethical considerations demand attention to three key areas:
1.  **Vocabulary in Governance:** The language used when discussing the governance of data initiatives needs to acknowledge and incorporate the environmental dimension, moving beyond purely digital or privacy-focused terms (NART103720250).
2.  **Tension with Environmental Policies:** There is an ""internal tension between current data initiatives and environmental policies."" The rapid expansion of Big Data often proceeds without adequate consideration for its ecological consequences, creating a conflict with broader sustainability goals (NART103720250).
3.  **Issues of Fair Distribution:** The environmental burdens and benefits associated with Big Data's material presence raise questions of ""fair distribution."" This implies concerns about who bears the environmental cost of data production and storage, and who benefits from its use (NART103720250). Addressing these aspects is crucial for fostering more responsible behavior in data storage and production.

###Conclusion###
In conclusion, the core argument is that Big Data initiatives, despite their digital nature, have a tangible and significant environmental impact due to the physical infrastructure required for data storage and processing. This material reality of data necessitates a broader ethical framework that considers not only traditional concerns like privacy and bias but also the environmental sustainability of these initiatives. A responsible approach to Big Data must integrate environmental policies, re-evaluate governance language, and ensure fair distribution of both the costs and benefits associated with data's physical footprint.",0.6758
How does the content describe the combination of phenomenological and mechanistic approaches through Big Data analytics to support personalized healthcare?,"##Integrating Empirical Insights and Mechanistic Models for Personalized Healthcare## ##Introduction## Personalized healthcare aims to tailor diagnosis and treatment to individual patients by combining two complementary modeling philosophies. Phenomenological approaches extract patterns directly from large-scale patient data, while mechanistic models build detailed, causal representations of physiological processes. Integrating these through Big Data analytics and Virtual Physiological Human (VPH) technologies offers a unified path toward in silico medicine. ##Main Body## Big Data analytics supplies the phenomenological component by uncovering correlations and trends across diverse, high-volume datasets. Mechanistic VPH models contribute causal understanding of tissue, organ, and whole-body dynamics. Neither approach stands alone; their fusion hinges on domain-specific technological advances. First, systems must securely manage and analyze sensitive, heterogeneous data—including nontextual formats—across distributed environments. Second, specialized analytics are needed to merge bioinformatics and systems biology insights with clinical observations at multiple scales. Finally, continuous data streams from daily life must be processed to delineate each patient’s “physiological envelope,” capturing normal variability and early signs of deviation. ##Conclusion## By addressing the challenges of data security, heterogeneity, distributed management, and multi-scale integration, Big Data technologies can bridge phenomenological and mechanistic paradigms. This synergy promises robust, patient-specific in silico medicine, marking a strategic priority for targeted research and funding in personalized healthcare.",없음,없음,"Title: Big data를 이용한 Warehouse Management System 모델 연구 : SAP S/4 Hana를 중심으로, Abstract: 본 연구는 오늘날 산업 전반적으로 영향을 미치고 있는 디지탈 전환(Digital Transformation)의 기술 환경과 디지탈 전환의 산업적 창고관리 부분의 모델연구가 본 논문의 목적이다. &amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 디지털 전환은 오랫동안 디지털화와 비슷하거나 또는 디지털 방식으로 저장할 수 있도록 기존 데이터 형태를 전환하는 것과 관련이 있다. 물론 이 점이 중요하긴 하지만, 이전의 디지털화는 최신 디지털 전환의 영역을 포함하지 않았었다.&amp;#xD; &amp;#xD; 특히 이번 연구에서는 Big Data를 중심으로 Warehouse Management System의 방향을 제시 하고자 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015305653,","Title: DTG 실 주행데이터 및 공간정보를 이용한 빅데이터 기반 연료소모량 추정 모델 연구, Abstract: 한국에서 교통사고를 줄이는 목적으로 디지털운행기록계(DTG) 장치가 모든 상용차량에 의무 장착이 되어 GPS 궤적을 포함한 많은 양의 운행기록 데이터가 생성되고 있다. 지금까지 이러한 DTG 데이터는 주로 교통안전운전을 유도하는 용도로 사용되어왔다. 그러나 DTG데이터는 연료소모량을 줄일 수 있는 에코드라이빙 분야 등 다양한 분야로 활용도를 확대할 수 있다. 본 연구는 실제 운행한 대규모 DTG운행 데이터를 공간 빅데이터 분석을 통해 연료소모량을 추정할 수 있는 모델을 수립하는 연구이다. 기존의 연료소모량 추정 모델은 주로 실험실 환경 또는 일부 지역에 국한되어 검증한 모델로 실제 운행되는 상용차량 대상으로 분석할 경우 수집하기 어려운 변수들이 많고, 한국의 전국을 운행한 다양한 운행기록 데이터를 적용하면 정확도가 낮아지는 문제점이 있다. 본 연구에서는 이러한 문제를 개선하기 위해 DTG데이터와 공간 빅데이터를 이용한 연료소모량 추정 모델인 SBiFEM(Spatial Big Data Fuel Estimation Model)을 제안하였다. SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment. The presentation will conclude with a set of requirements and a summary of recommendations for future priorities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12562650,","Title: Artificial intelligence and Big Data in neurology, Abstract: ABSTRACTRecent advances in technology have allowed us access to a multitude of datasets pertaining to various dimensions in neurology.

Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002721909,","Title: Big Data cluster analysis, Abstract: In this paper, we focused on cluster analysis as the most commonly used technique for grouping different objects. By clustering data, we can extract groups of similar objects from different collections. First, we defined Big Data and clustering to follow the rest of the paper. We presented the most popular techniques for clustering data, including partitioning, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and network-based clustering. Big Data describes large amounts of data. High precision of big data can contribute to decision-making confidence, and better estimates can help increase efficiency, reduce costs, and risks. Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately. We described the K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering -DBSCAN algorithm, and the STING algorithm for network-based clustering., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131203869,","Title: The Big Student Big Data Grab, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART80312419,","Title: Zwangsehen und Bastarde : Wohin steuert Big Data die Wissenschaft?, Abstract: AbstractWhen the word &ldquo;science&rdquo; comes up in the context of big data, one usually thinks of scientists who make accurate predictions about future developments, events and actions by means of sophisticated analyses - or who influence behaviour with surgical precision, such as it is conveyed from Donald Trump's successful election campaign. However, scientists are no longer just agents in big data scenarios, but also objects. The measurement of science today is not only based on simple citation counts or obtained project funds: Commercial actors are creating an entire operating system with integrated tools that continuously record the behaviour of scientists and the performance of science.

Following the initiatives of open data, many organizations including municipal governments are willing to share their data such as open big data regarding parking violations. While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected. Hence, in this article, we present a model for supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data. This temporally hierarchical privacy-preserving model (THPPM) adapts and extends the traditional temporal hierarchy to generalize spatial data generated within a time interval with an aim to preserve privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations during some time intervals at certain geographic locations.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

It also undertakes empirical analyses of user modeling to explore the factors influencing users' adoption of big data by integrating cognitive motivations as well as user values as the primary determining factors. Based on the qualitative and quantitative findings, this study concludes that big data should be developed with user-centered ideas and that users should be the focus of big data design.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though.

If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201626360541485,","Title: Big Data ethics, Abstract: The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects.

While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches.

This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0. This is an important first step and will have a significant influence on implementing the concept of big data inside the statistical offices of Germany., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74180896,","Title: Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review, Abstract: AbstractValue Chain has been considered as a key model for managing efficiently value creation processes within organizations. However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy. Thus, analysis has continued for a long time in the quantity and quality of data, and there are changes in the location of data in the social sciences, past trends and the emergence of big data. The introduction of big data is presented as a prototype of new social science and is a useful practical example that empirically shows the need, basis, and direction of analysis through trend prediction services.

## Introduction ##
Personalized healthcare, also known as precision medicine, aims to tailor medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient. This endeavor often involves navigating seemingly contradictory approaches: the purely phenomenological knowledge derived from observing large-scale data patterns and the desire for detailed mechanistic models that explain biological processes at an individual level. Big Data analytics plays a crucial role in bridging this gap, enabling a synergistic combination of these two perspectives to deliver more effective and robust healthcare solutions.

## Main Body ##
The content describes the combination of phenomenological and mechanistic approaches through Big Data analytics as a means to overcome the inherent tension between these two paradigms. While phenomenological knowledge, extracted from analyzing vast amounts of data, focuses on observable patterns and correlations, mechanistic models aim to understand the underlying biological systems and their causal relationships. In practice, no model is entirely one or the other, necessitating their integration.

Big Data analytics facilitates this combination by:
*   **Guiding Hypothesis Formulation and Mechanistic Model Generation**: Data-driven methods, powered by Big Data analytics, offer the possibility to formulate hypotheses about how biological systems function. These hypotheses then guide the generation of detailed mechanistic models, which are essential for understanding disease processes and treatment responses at an individual level.
*   **Integrating Diverse Data Sources**: Big Data technologies are developed to cope with complex and heterogeneous data spaces. This includes integrating bioinformatics and systems biology information (representing mechanistic insights) with clinical observations and non-textual information (representing phenomenological data). For instance, in cardiovascular healthcare, Big Data analytics integrates genomic, proteomic, and lifestyle data to understand complex biological mechanisms and predict personalized medicine outcomes, particularly in pharmacogenomics.
*   **Defining the ""Physiological Envelope""**: Specialized analytics can be used to define a patient's ""physiological envelope"" during their daily life. This involves capturing real-world, often unstructured, data about a patient's condition and activities, which is a phenomenological approach. By integrating this with mechanistic understanding, a more comprehensive view of the patient's health can be achieved.
*   **Enabling Precision Medicine**: The ability of Big Data analytics to process and interpret enormous, rapidly growing collections of biomedical ""omics"" data (genomics, proteomics, etc.) and clinical data allows for the design of robust algorithms. These algorithms consider individual variability in genes, directly enabling the creation of precision (personalized) medicine by informing drug selection and dosing based on genetic variations.

## Conclusion ##
In essence, Big Data analytics serves as the connective tissue, allowing the insights gleaned from broad, data-driven phenomenological observations to inform and refine the construction of detailed, individual-specific mechanistic models. This integrated approach leads to the development of ""in silico medicine solutions"" that are both robust and effective, ultimately transforming personalized healthcare by providing deeper insights into disease mechanisms, improving patient care, and optimizing clinical procedures.",0.6758
What are the key findings of the socio-technical evaluation on Big Data developmental processes and the factors influencing user adoption?,"##Socio-Technical Evaluation and User Adoption in Big Data Development## ##Introduction## This study examines how Big Data practices emerge, become routinized, and integrate into organizations by applying a socio-technical lens. Using Normalization Process Theory, it analyzes the interplay between technology, organizational context, and human actors in South Korea’s Big Data ecosystem. It also investigates what drives or hinders individual users from embracing Big Data tools and insights. ##Main Body## • Developmental Processes: The evaluation identifies three core mechanisms—coherence (making sense of Big Data), cognitive participation (buy-in from stakeholders), and collective action (operational work to embed new practices). It reveals that successful integration depends on clear role definitions, shared understanding of expected benefits, and alignment with existing workflows. • Implementation Challenges: Technical complexity, insufficient training, and fragmented data governance emerged as obstacles to embedding Big Data solutions. Organizational support structures, such as cross-functional collaboration and continuous feedback channels, proved critical for sustaining adoption. • User Adoption Factors: Empirical user modeling highlights two primary drivers: cognitive motivations (perceived usefulness, ease of interpretation) and individual values (trust, data privacy concerns, alignment with personal goals). Users are more likely to adopt Big Data when interfaces communicate actionable insights and respect ethical considerations. • Design Implications: The findings underscore the need for user-centered development, where end-users participate in requirement setting, iterative prototyping, and evaluation. Tailoring data visualization and analytics to users’ domain expertise significantly enhances perceived value and motivation to engage. ##Conclusion## Achieving widespread adoption of Big Data depends on attending to both socio-technical dynamics and human factors.

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment.

But in practice no model is ever entirely phenomenological or entirely mechanistic. We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry.

We presented the most popular techniques for clustering data, including partitioning, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and network-based clustering.

Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

Then taking smart grid as the research background, we provide a systematic review of big data analytics for smart energy management. It is discussed from four major aspects, namely power generation side management, microgrid and renewable energy management, asset management and collaborative operation, as well as demand side management (DSM). Afterwards, the industrial development of big data-driven smart energy management is analyzed and discussed. Finally, we point out the challenges of big data-driven smart energy management in IT infrastructure, data collection and governance, data integration and sharing, processing and analysis, security and privacy, and professionals., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74782503,","Title: Nursing Needs Big Data and Big Data Needs Nursing, Abstract: AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76701778,","Title: Optimized Data Processing Analysis Using Big Data Cloud Platform, Abstract: Recently data processing has main gained many attention both from academic and commercial industry. Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data. In addition, we provides results from a study of existing optimization of data processing in MapReduce and Hadoop oriented systems., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002687869,","Title: Big Data in Building Energy Efficiency: Understanding of Big Data and Main Challenges, Abstract: Data generation has increased drastically over the past few years. Data management has also grown in importance because extracting the significant value out of a huge pile of raw data is of prime important thing to make different decisions. One of the important sectors nowadays is construction sector, especially building energy efficiency field. Collecting big amount of data, using different kinds of big data analysis can help to improve construction process from the energy efficiency perspective.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12215719,","Title: Big Data Smoothing and Outlier Removal for Patent Big Data Analysis, Abstract: In general statistical analysis, we need to make a normal assumption. If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201626360541485,","Title: Big Data ethics, Abstract: The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects. We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone. Responses will require a rethinking of ethical choices, the lack thereof and how this will guide scientists, governments, and corporate agencies in handling Big Data.

This development intensifies the information asymmetry between the dominant and vulnerable parties, posing increasing challenges for consumers and the entirety of European contract law. This paper offers three main contributions to this discourse. First, the utilization of big data introduces a novel form of information asymmetry between contracting parties, further empowering the already dominant party while exacerbating the vulnerability of the weaker party. Second, contemporary European case law and legal scholarship advocate for a harmonious approach in which European regulations and national remedies complement one another in protecting individuals. Lastly, there are already instances indicating the misuse of big data, where multiple individual claims may arise at both European and national levels., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132663034,","Title: Big data? Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR, Abstract: Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112101193,","Title: &#x201e;Massendinghaltung“ oder &#x201e;Big Data“?, Abstract: SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage.

Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0.

However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy.

### Introduction ###
Socio-technical evaluations of Big Data developmental processes and user adoption highlight the complex interplay between technological advancements and human/organizational factors. These studies aim to understand how Big Data practices are implemented and integrated, as well as the various elements that drive or hinder its adoption by users. The findings emphasize the necessity of a holistic approach that considers both the technical aspects and the social context for successful Big Data initiatives.

### Main Body ###
**Key Findings on Big Data Developmental Processes:**
A socio-technical evaluation of Big Data developmental processes, particularly in South Korea, focuses on understanding how new practices of thinking and enacting Big Data are implemented, embedded, and integrated. A primary conclusion from this evaluation is that Big Data should be developed with user-centered ideas, placing users at the core of Big Data design (Doc 1). Furthermore, in higher education institutions, an oriented-organizational culture positively impacts Big Data tasks such as storing, analyzing, and visualizing, leading to improved decision-making by top management and enhanced organizational performance. However, paradoxically, the Big Data tasks themselves were found to negatively affect the improvement of decision-making by top management in these institutions (Doc 25).

**Factors Influencing User Adoption of Big Data:**
Multiple studies identify a wide range of factors influencing user adoption of Big Data and Big Data Analytics (BDA), categorized into several key areas:

1.  **Socio-Technical and Contextual Factors:**
    *   **Healthcare Services:** Key socio-technical factors include aspects related to the *person* (analytical skills), *technology* (system quality, information quality), *organization* (support, resources, training, data governance, evidence-based decision-making), and *environment* (government regulations) (Doc 2).
    *   **General Adoption Models:** Popular theoretical models like Technology–Organization–Environment (TOE) and Diffusion of Innovations are frequently used to understand Big Data adoption, revealing 42 significant influencing factors across technology, organization, environment, and innovation domains (Doc 3).
    *   **Elusiveness and Transformative Effect:** Big Data technologies are often an elusive concept, meaning different things to different organizations, which makes them difficult to explain to investing bodies. They also have a transformative effect on the organization of work, potentially threatening managerial positions and creating ripple effects across other systems (Doc 8).

2.  **Technological and System-Related Factors:**
    *   **Technological Drivers:** The technological driver of BDA, especially when coupled with top management support, significantly aids the adoption process (Doc 11).
    *   **System Quality and Information Quality:** These are crucial characteristics of technology influencing adoption (Doc 2).
    *   **Infrastructure:** The importance of a good infrastructure is highlighted, often exceeding the difficulties companies face in implementing it (Doc 9).
    *   **Task-Technology Fit (TTF):** Factors like task characteristics and technology characteristics are strong influencers of TTF, which in turn is a strong predictor of users' behavioral intention to adopt a BDA system (Doc 15).

3.  **Organizational Factors:**
    *   **Organizational Support and Resources:** Essential for BDA adoption in healthcare (Doc 2).
    *   **Top Management Support:** Crucial for fostering organizational adoption of BDA (Doc 11).
    *   **Strategic Value Perception:** A positive perception of strategic value and internal industry environmental factors positively influence Big Data adoption intention (Doc 6).
    *   **Organizational Culture:** An oriented-organizational culture can support BDA tasks and improve decision-making (Doc 25).

4.  **Individual and Behavioral Factors:**
    *   **User-Centered Ideas and Values:** Big Data design should focus on users and integrate cognitive motivations and user values as primary determining factors for adoption (Doc 1).
    *   **Perceived Usefulness and Ease of Use:** These are statistically significant predictors of Big Data adoption, with their relationship being moderated by the extent of behavioral intention (Doc 10).
    *   **Individual Perception, Security, and Risk:** These are key factors in Big Data adoption models, particularly in contexts like Smart Universities (Doc 13).
    *   **Behavioral Intention:** A strong predictor of actual adoption, positively moderated by extrinsic motivation and negatively moderated by resistance to change (Doc 15).
    *   **Resistance to Use and Perceived Risk:** These variables are important considerations in models of technology adoption for BDA (Doc 9).
    *   **Deliberate Storytelling:** Plays a facilitating role in individual-level BDA adoption by disseminating corporate stories to influence behavior (Doc 16).
    *   **Technological Factors and Readiness:** Technological factors influence participants' perception of their readiness for Big Data, which then affects their interest in utilizing it (Doc 4).

### Conclusion ###
The socio-technical evaluation of Big Data developmental processes underscores the critical need for user-centered design and the positive impact of an appropriate organizational culture on Big Data tasks and decision-making. The factors influencing user adoption are multifaceted, encompassing individual perceptions (cognitive motivations, user values, perceived usefulness, ease of use, resistance, risk), technological characteristics (system/information quality, infrastructure, task-technology fit), organizational support (resources, training, data governance, top management support, strategic value perception), and environmental considerations (government regulations). Successful Big Data adoption requires a comprehensive understanding and strategic management of these interconnected socio-technical elements.",0.6758

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment. The presentation will conclude with a set of requirements and a summary of recommendations for future priorities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12562650,","Title: Artificial intelligence and Big Data in neurology, Abstract: ABSTRACTRecent advances in technology have allowed us access to a multitude of datasets pertaining to various dimensions in neurology.

We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002721909,","Title: Big Data cluster analysis, Abstract: In this paper, we focused on cluster analysis as the most commonly used technique for grouping different objects. By clustering data, we can extract groups of similar objects from different collections. First, we defined Big Data and clustering to follow the rest of the paper. We presented the most popular techniques for clustering data, including partitioning, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and network-based clustering. Big Data describes large amounts of data. High precision of big data can contribute to decision-making confidence, and better estimates can help increase efficiency, reduce costs, and risks. Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately. We described the K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering -DBSCAN algorithm, and the STING algorithm for network-based clustering., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131203869,","Title: The Big Student Big Data Grab, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART80312419,","Title: Zwangsehen und Bastarde : Wohin steuert Big Data die Wissenschaft?, Abstract: AbstractWhen the word &ldquo;science&rdquo; comes up in the context of big data, one usually thinks of scientists who make accurate predictions about future developments, events and actions by means of sophisticated analyses - or who influence behaviour with surgical precision, such as it is conveyed from Donald Trump's successful election campaign.

While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects.

If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization.

I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes.

This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage. These effects, collectively known as the &ldquo;data deluge,&rdquo; affect synchrotrons in several different ways including fast data collection, available local storage, data management systems, and curation of the data. This review highlights the Big Data strategies adopted nowadays at synchrotrons, documenting this novel and promising hybridization between science and technology, which promise a dramatic increase in the number of scientific discoveries., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91047593,","Title: Why Big Data = Big Deal, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART69962531,","Title: Exploring Big Data Governance Frameworks, Abstract: Abstract The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91115436,","Title: Big Data 2.0, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001707649,","Title: Big genetic data and its big data protection challenges, Abstract: Abstract The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0. This is an important first step and will have a significant influence on implementing the concept of big data inside the statistical offices of Germany., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74180896,","Title: Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review, Abstract: AbstractValue Chain has been considered as a key model for managing efficiently value creation processes within organizations. However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy.

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers. With Normalization Process Theory in place, this study conducts socio-technical evaluation on the big data phenomenon to understand the developmental processes through which new practices of thinking and enacting are implemented, embedded, and integrated in South Korea. It also undertakes empirical analyses of user modeling to explore the factors influencing users' adoption of big data by integrating cognitive motivations as well as user values as the primary determining factors.

Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though.

If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201626360541485,","Title: Big Data ethics, Abstract: The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects.

This paper offers three main contributions to this discourse. First, the utilization of big data introduces a novel form of information asymmetry between contracting parties, further empowering the already dominant party while exacerbating the vulnerability of the weaker party. Second, contemporary European case law and legal scholarship advocate for a harmonious approach in which European regulations and national remedies complement one another in protecting individuals.

Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR, Abstract: Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112101193,","Title: &#x201e;Massendinghaltung“ oder &#x201e;Big Data“?, Abstract: SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;.

The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0.

However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains.

##서론##
SBiFEM(Spatial Big Data Fuel Estimation Model)은 디지털운행기록계(DTG) 실 주행데이터와 공간 빅데이터를 활용하여 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델입니다. 이 모델은 기존 연료소모량 추정 모델의 한계점인 실제 운행 환경 반영의 어려움과 낮은 정확도를 개선하기 위해 제안되었습니다. SBiFEM은 운전자의 운행 특성과 도로의 다양한 환경 정보를 반영하는 것을 목표로 하며, 이를 위해 세 가지 핵심 구성 요소를 포함하는 공간 빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 수립하고 구현합니다.

##본론##
SBiFEM의 핵심 구성 요소는 다음과 같습니다.

1.  **전처리 기술 고도화:** 센싱 데이터 및 GPS 공간 데이터에 존재하는 많은 양의 이상치(Outlier) 데이터를 정제하는 과정입니다. 신뢰할 수 있는 분석 결과를 얻기 위해 통계 기법과 운행 패턴 분석을 활용한 필터링 기법을 연구하여 데이터의 품질을 향상시킵니다.
2.  **대량의 GPS 궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간 빅데이터 분석 체계:** 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해 차량이 어느 도로에 위치했는지 파악하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적입니다. SBiFEM은 실시간 내비게이션 용도와 달리 빠른 분석 속도를 요구하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하도록 대량의 GPS 궤적 데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하여 공간 정보를 효율적으로 처리합니다.
3.  **연료소모량 추정 모델:** 이 모델은 실제 운행 환경을 보다 정확하게 반영하기 위해 두 가지 유형의 변수를 추가합니다.
    *   **차량 운행 특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴:** 운전자의 주행 습관이나 차량의 동적 특성 등을 포함합니다.
    *   **전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보:** 맵매칭 공간 빅데이터 프로세스를 통해 수집된 도로의 경사도, 곡률, 교통 흐름 등 다양한 환경 정보를 활용하여 연료소모량 추정의 정확도를 높입니다.

이러한 구성 요소들은 빅데이터 Map Reduce 기술을 활용하는 공간 빅데이터 분석 프로세스 전반에 걸쳐 유기적으로 작동하여 SBiFEM의 성능을 최적화합니다.

##결론##
SBiFEM은 전처리 기술 고도화, 대량의 GPS 궤적 데이터를 활용한 공간 빅데이터 분석 체계, 그리고 운행 패턴 및 도로 환경 정보를 반영한 연료소모량 추정 모델이라는 세 가지 핵심 구성 요소를 통해 DTG 실 주행데이터와 공간정보를 효과적으로 통합하여 연료소모량을 정밀하게 추정합니다. 이러한 접근 방식은 실제 운행 환경의 복잡성을 반영하여 기존 모델의 정확도 한계를 극복하고, 에코드라이빙 등 다양한 분야에서의 활용 가능성을 높이는 데 기여합니다.",0.6758

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment.

We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions.

Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry.

Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

To fulfill the potential of energy big data and obtain insights to achieve smart energy management, we present a comprehensive study of big data driven smart energy management. We first discuss the sources and characteristics of energy big data. Also, a process model of big data driven smart energy management is proposed. Then taking smart grid as the research background, we provide a systematic review of big data analytics for smart energy management. It is discussed from four major aspects, namely power generation side management, microgrid and renewable energy management, asset management and collaborative operation, as well as demand side management (DSM). Afterwards, the industrial development of big data-driven smart energy management is analyzed and discussed. Finally, we point out the challenges of big data-driven smart energy management in IT infrastructure, data collection and governance, data integration and sharing, processing and analysis, security and privacy, and professionals., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74782503,","Title: Nursing Needs Big Data and Big Data Needs Nursing, Abstract: AbstractPurposeContemporary big data initiatives in health care will benefit from greater integration with nursing science and nursing practice; in turn, nursing science and nursing practice has much to gain from the data science initiatives. Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76701778,","Title: Optimized Data Processing Analysis Using Big Data Cloud Platform, Abstract: Recently data processing has main gained many attention both from academic and commercial industry. Their term use to tools, technical methods and frameworks made to gathering, collect, store, processing and analysis massive amounts of data. Data processing and analysis are based on structured/semi -structured/unstructured by big data, as well as is generated from various different sources in the system at various rates. For the purpose of processing with their large data and suitable way, voluminous parallelism is usually used. The general architecture of a big data system is made up a shared cluster of their machines. Nonetheless, even in very parallel environment, data processing is often very time-consuming. A various applications can take up to everytime to produce useful results, interactive analysis and debugging. Nevertheless, we have main problems that how we have a high performance requires both quality of data locality and resource. Moreover, big data analysis provide the amount of data that is processed typically large in comparison with computation in their systems. In other words, specified optimization that would relieve low-level to achieve good performance essentially. Accordingly, our main goal of this research paper provide how we have to do to optimize for big data frameworks. Our contribute approach to make big data cloud platform for easy and efficient processing of big data.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though. Big Data Quality varies from one type of Big Data to another and from one Big Data technology to another., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12215719,","Title: Big Data Smoothing and Outlier Removal for Patent Big Data Analysis, Abstract: In general statistical analysis, we need to make a normal assumption. If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201626360541485,","Title: Big Data ethics, Abstract: The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects. We are moving towards changes in how ethics has to be perceived: away from individual decisions with specific and knowable outcomes, towards actions by many unaware that they may have taken actions with unintended consequences for anyone.

This development intensifies the information asymmetry between the dominant and vulnerable parties, posing increasing challenges for consumers and the entirety of European contract law. This paper offers three main contributions to this discourse. First, the utilization of big data introduces a novel form of information asymmetry between contracting parties, further empowering the already dominant party while exacerbating the vulnerability of the weaker party. Second, contemporary European case law and legal scholarship advocate for a harmonious approach in which European regulations and national remedies complement one another in protecting individuals.

Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR, Abstract: Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112101193,","Title: &#x201e;Massendinghaltung“ oder &#x201e;Big Data“?, Abstract: SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage.

Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0.

However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy.

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment. The presentation will conclude with a set of requirements and a summary of recommendations for future priorities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12562650,","Title: Artificial intelligence and Big Data in neurology, Abstract: ABSTRACTRecent advances in technology have allowed us access to a multitude of datasets pertaining to various dimensions in neurology.

It argues that attention should be paid to (1) the vocabulary currently used when discussing the governance of data initiatives; (2) the internal tension between current data initiatives and environmental policies; (3) issues of fair distribution. The article explains how taking into account these aspects would allow for a more responsible behaviour in the context of data storage and production., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART103720250,","Title: Enjeux des big data en sant&eacute;, Abstract: Summary The government has commissioned a report on the topic, the Estates General on Bioethics refer to it and the Order of Doctors have published a white paper.

We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002721909,","Title: Big Data cluster analysis, Abstract: In this paper, we focused on cluster analysis as the most commonly used technique for grouping different objects. By clustering data, we can extract groups of similar objects from different collections. First, we defined Big Data and clustering to follow the rest of the paper. We presented the most popular techniques for clustering data, including partitioning, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering, and network-based clustering. Big Data describes large amounts of data. High precision of big data can contribute to decision-making confidence, and better estimates can help increase efficiency, reduce costs, and risks. Various methods and approaches are used for data processing, including clustering, classification, regression, artificial intelligence, neural networks, association rules, decision trees, genetic algorithms, and the nearest neighbor method. A cluster represents a set of objects from the same class, which means that similar objects are grouped together, and different objects are grouped separately. We described the K-means algorithm, hierarchical clustering, density-based clustering -DBSCAN algorithm, and the STING algorithm for network-based clustering., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART131203869,","Title: The Big Student Big Data Grab, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART80312419,","Title: Zwangsehen und Bastarde : Wohin steuert Big Data die Wissenschaft?, Abstract: AbstractWhen the word &ldquo;science&rdquo; comes up in the context of big data, one usually thinks of scientists who make accurate predictions about future developments, events and actions by means of sophisticated analyses - or who influence behaviour with surgical precision, such as it is conveyed from Donald Trump's successful election campaign.

While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected.

This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects.

If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization.

I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes.

This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science. Additionally, the lack of an appropriate data analysis environment limits the realization of experiments that generate a large amount of data in a very short period of time. The current lack of automated data analysis pipelines prevents the fine&#8208;tuning of beam&#8208;time experiments, further reducing their potential usage. These effects, collectively known as the &ldquo;data deluge,&rdquo; affect synchrotrons in several different ways including fast data collection, available local storage, data management systems, and curation of the data. This review highlights the Big Data strategies adopted nowadays at synchrotrons, documenting this novel and promising hybridization between science and technology, which promise a dramatic increase in the number of scientific discoveries., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91047593,","Title: Why Big Data = Big Deal, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART69962531,","Title: Exploring Big Data Governance Frameworks, Abstract: Abstract The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making. Nowadays organizations can store huge amounts of data, which can be accessible at any time. Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91115436,","Title: Big Data 2.0, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001707649,","Title: Big genetic data and its big data protection challenges, Abstract: Abstract The use of various forms of big data have revolutionised scientific research. This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854,","Title: Big Data in der amtlichen Statistik, Abstract: The concept of 'big data' stands to change the face of official statistics over the coming years, having an impact on almost all aspects of data production. The tasks of future statisticians will not necessarily be to produce new data, but rather to identify and make use of existing data to adequately describe social and economic phenomena. Until big data can be used correctly in official statistics, a lot of questions need to be answered and problems solved: the quality of data, data protection, privacy, and the sustainable availability are some of the more pressing issues to be addressed. The essential skills of official statisticians will undoubtedly change, and this implies a number of challenges to be faced by statistical education systems, in universities, and inside the statistical offices. The national statistical offices of the European Union have concluded a concrete strategy for exploring the possibilities of big data for official statistics, by means of the Big Data Roadmap and Action Plan 1.0. This is an important first step and will have a significant influence on implementing the concept of big data inside the statistical offices of Germany., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART74180896,","Title: Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review, Abstract: AbstractValue Chain has been considered as a key model for managing efficiently value creation processes within organizations. However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280,","Title: Utilization and Analysis of Big-data, Abstract: This study reviews the analysis and characteristics of databases from big data and then establishes representational strategy.

패키징 분야 빅데이터 분석 기법 및 소비자 인식 분석 방안 요약

##서론##
패키징 분야는 4차 산업혁명 시대에 발맞춰 IoT, 빅데이터, 클라우드 등 소비자 기반 기술을 적용한 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있으며, 마케팅적 요소가 중요해지면서 소비자의 인식을 파악하는 것이 필수적입니다. 이를 위해 다양한 빅데이터 분석 기법이 활용되고 있으며, 소비자 인식 분석은 패키징 연구 및 산업 발전에 중요한 기초 자료를 제공합니다.

##본론##
**1. 패키징 분야에서의 빅데이터 분석 기법**
패키징 분야에서 소비자의 인식을 분석하고 제품 개선 및 마케팅 전략을 수립하기 위해 다음과 같은 빅데이터 분석 기법들이 활용됩니다.

*   **텍스트 마이닝(Text mining):** 웹 및 SNS 데이터와 같은 비정형 텍스트 데이터에서 유의미한 정보를 추출하는 기법입니다. 패키징에 대한 소비자들의 주요 인식을 조사하고, 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하는 데 사용됩니다. (JAKO201813742061433, JAKO201708260283459)
*   **의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis):** 텍스트 마이닝을 통해 추출된 키워드들 간의 연결 구조와 관계를 분석하여 소비자 인식의 핵심 주제를 도출합니다. (JAKO201813742061433, JAKO201708260283459)
*   **CONCOR 분석:** 유사한 의미를 가지는 키워드들을 그룹으로 분류하여 패키징에 대한 소비자들의 주요 인식을 연구, 개발, 산업, 소재, 기능 등과 같은 범주로 요약하는 데 활용됩니다. (JAKO201813742061433)
*   **빈도분석:** 패키징 관련 키워드의 출현 빈도를 분석하여 소비자들이 가장 많이 언급하거나 중요하게 생각하는 요소를 파악합니다. (JAKO201708260283459)
*   **오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining):** 소비자들이 패키징에 대해 표현하는 감정(긍정/부정)을 분석하여 특정 제품군에서 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 데 사용됩니다. (JAKO201708260283459)
*   **소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis):** 소셜 미디어 데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자들의 상호작용 및 감정을 분석합니다. (JAKO201708260283459)

**2. 소비자 인식 분석 방안**
패키징에 대한 소비자 인식을 분석하는 구체적인 방안은 다음과 같습니다.

*   **웹 및 SNS 데이터 수집 및 분석:** 텍스톰(Textom)과 같은 웹&SNS 데이터 분석 프로그램을 활용하여 일정 기간 동안의 데이터를 수집하고, 이를 텍스트 마이닝, 의미연결망 분석, CONCOR 분석 등을 통해 처리합니다. 이를 통해 소비자들이 패키징 소재(예: 합성수지), 기능(예: 보관), 관련 상품군(예: 제약, 의약품) 등에 대해 주로 인식하는 바를 파악할 수 있습니다. (JAKO201813742061433)

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515,","Title: Big Data 활용을 위한 제조 품질 개선 방법에 대한 연구, Abstract: 20세기 대량 생산 시대 이래로 제조 기업의 품질은 가장 중요한 요소가 되어왔다. 따라서 품질에 대한 올바른 정의와 품질 개선을 위한 다양한 도구와 방법이 개발되어 왔으며 이의 효율적 적용을 위한 노력도 병행되어 왔다. 이러한 노력은 제조 기업의 품질 제일주의, 전사적 품질 경영, 식스 시그마 등을 통하여 정형화되고 다양한 분야에 적용되고 있다. 또한 최근 Big Data의 유용성이 소개되면서 이에 대한 제조 업계의 관심이 높아지고 있으나 이에 대한 적용은 아직 미흡한 면이 있다. 본 논문은 기존의 품질 개선을 위한 프로젝트 실행 방법을 정리해 보고 대표적인 프로젝트 중심의 개선 방법인 식스 시그마의 실행 방법을 기준으로 Big Data 활용 방법을 제안해 보기로 한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0015505861,","Title: 패키징(Packaging) 분야에서의 빅데이터(Big data) 적용방안 연구, Abstract: 패키징 분야도 4차 산업혁명에 발 맞춰 IoT (Internet of Things), 빅데이터, 클라우드 및 소비자 기반 기술 등이 적용되어 스마트 패키징이 등장하고 있다. 정책, 예측, 마케팅, 디자인 등 다양한 분야에서 빅데이터 분석이 활용되고 있지만 패키징 분야에서의 연구는 아직 초보적 수준이다. 따라서 본 연구는 빅데이터를 패키징 분야에 적용하기 위해 선행연구과 관련서적을 통해 빅데이터의 정의와 연구에서 활용되는 데이터 수집, 저장, 분석방법을 정리하였고 패키징 분야에 적용할 수 있는 분석방법을 제시하였다. 오늘날 패키징 분야는 마케팅적 요소를 요구받고 있기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 파악할 필요가 있으며 빅데이터의 근원이 되는 5가지 데이터 중 사유데이터(private data)와 커뮤니티 데이터(community data)를 활용하여 소비자와 제품 간의 상호작용 분석하는데 활용하고자 한다. 패키징은 소비자의 관심을 끌기 위한 전략전인 도구로 사용되며 소비자의 구매위험을 줄이는 수단이 되기 때문에 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식을 분석할 필요가 있다. 본 연구에서는 제품 개선을 위한 문제점 도출 과정에서 의미연결망 분석(Semantic Network Analysis)과 텍스트마이닝(Text mining)을 활용하여 제품을 구성하는 다양한 요소들을 파악하고 패키징 요소의 빈도분석을 거쳐 패키징의 영향력을 확인하는 방안과 저관여 제품을 대상으로 텍스트 마이닝(Text mining)과 오피니언 마이닝(Opinion Mining), 소셜 네트워크 분석(Social Network Analysis)을 통해 패키징에 대한 감정분석을 하여 동일한 제품군에서 소비자가 선호하는 패키징을 도출하는 방안을 제시하였다. 패키징은 제품을 구성하는 많은 요소들 중 하나이기 때문에 패키징이라는 단일 요소의 영향력을 파악하기란 쉽지 않지만 본 연구는 빅데이터를 활용하여 패키징에 대한 소비자의 인식과 감정을 분석하고 제품에서 패키징이 소비자에게 미치는 영향력을 분석할 수 있는 방안을 제시한 데 의의가 있다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201708260283459,","Title: 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템 개발, Abstract: 본 논문은 산업 현장과 민간에서 실시간으로 수집되는 에너지 빅데이터를 수용하는 빅데이터 시스템을 제안한다. 구축된 빅데이터 시스템은 하둡(Hadoop) 기반이며, 빅데이터 처리에 있어 인메모리(in-memory) 분산처리 컴퓨팅을 지원하는 스파크(Spark) 프레임워크가 동시에 적용되었다. 본문에서는 지역난방에 사용되는 열에너지 형태의 빅데이터에 초점을 두어, 입출력되는 에너지의 특성을 고려하며 실시간 수집되는 빅데이터를 적재, 관리, 처리 및 분석하는 방법을 다룬다. 이 때, 외부에서 유입되는 빅데이터는 시스템 내부에 설계된 관계형 데이터베이스 스키마에 따라 저장하고 관리되며, 저장된 빅데이터는 설정된 목적에 따라 처리하고 분석된다. 제안된 빅데이터 시스템과 더불어 지역난방과 관련한 복수의 실증현장으로부터 실시간으로 수집되는 열에너지 빅데이터에 대해 시스템이 활용된 사례를 기술한다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201823952425544,","Title: AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 보안관리 요소들의 우선순위 분석에 관한 연구, Abstract: IT기술의 발전은 기존의 컴퓨터 환경과 더불어 수많은 모바일 환경 및 사물 인터넷환경을 통해 사람의 삶을 편리하게 하고 있다. 이러한 모바일과 인터넷 환경의 등장으로 데이터가 급속히 폭증하고 있으며, 이러한 환경에서 데이터를 경제적인 자산으로 활용 가능한 Big Data 환경과 서비스가 등장하고 있다. 그러나 Big Data를 활용한 서비스는 증가하고 있지만, 이러한 서비스를 위해 발생되는 다량의 데이터에는 보안적 문제점이 있음에도 불구하고 Big Data의 보안성에 대한 논의는 미흡한 실정이다. 그리고 기존의 Big Data에 대한 보안적인 측면의 연구들은 Big Data의 보안이 아닌 Big Data를 활용한 서비스의 보안이 주를 이루고 있다. 이에 따라서 본 연구에서는 Big Data의 서비스 산업의 활성화를 위하여 Big Data의 보안에 대한 연구를 하였다. 세부적으로 AHP 기법을 활용한 Big Data 환경에서 보안관리를 위한 구성요소를 파악하고 그에 대한 우선순위를 도출하였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201336447760856,","Title: Keynote speech 6: Big Data, IoT and the 2nd sustainable development goal, Abstract: The risks associated with the global food system are widely acknowledged and implicate a complex nexus of factors including increasing population, changing diets, erosion of natural capital, uncertain future climate, food price fluctuations, growing economic disparity and differential access to sufficient safe and nutritious food. The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored. This will include the potential role of IoT and Big Data related technologies and an evaluation of the feasibilities and risks associated with their deployment.

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry.

Following the initiatives of open data, many organizations including municipal governments are willing to share their data such as open big data regarding parking violations. While there have been models to preserve privacy of sensitive personal data like patient data for health informatics, privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations should also be protected. Hence, in this article, we present a model for supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data. This temporally hierarchical privacy-preserving model (THPPM) adapts and extends the traditional temporal hierarchy to generalize spatial data generated within a time interval with an aim to preserve privacy of individuals who violated parking regulations during some time intervals at certain geographic locations. Evaluation on open big data from two North American cities demonstrates the usefulness of our model in supporting privacy-preserving big data analytics on temporal open big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117405992,","Title: Big business with Big Data Big Business mit Big Data, Abstract: Big business with Big Data Big Business mit Big Data, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART113110241,","Title: Sharing big biomedical data, Abstract: BackgroundThe promise of Big Biomedical Data may be offset by the enormous challenges in handling, analyzing, and sharing it. In this paper, we provide a framework for developing practical and reasonable data sharing policies that incorporate the sociological, financial, technical and scientific requirements of a sustainable Big Data dependent scientific community.FindingsMany biomedical and healthcare studies may be significantly impacted by using large, heterogeneous and incongruent datasets; however there are significant technical, social, regulatory, and institutional barriers that need to be overcome to ensure the power of Big Data overcomes these detrimental factors.ConclusionsPragmatic policies that demand extensive sharing of data, promotion of data fusion, provenance, interoperability and balance security and protection of personal information are critical for the long term impact of translational Big Data analytics., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART80716289,","Title: Protecting Privacy in Big Data, Abstract: In an age of big data, privacy is more essential than ever before, but if we are to protect it effectively, while continuing to enjoy the benefits that big data is already making possible, we need to evolve better, faster, and more scalable mechanisms.The following are the four core elements critical to effective governance of big data.First, a transformation of the current approach to a risk management approach that places more responsibility for data stewardship, and liability for reasonably foreseeable harms, on the users of data rather than using notice and consent to shift the burden to individuals seems critical. This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011,","Title: Demystifying big data: Anatomy of big data developmental process, Abstract: This study seeks to understand big data ecology, how it is perceived by different stakeholders, the potential value and challenges, and the implications for the private sector and public organizations, as well as for policy makers. With Normalization Process Theory in place, this study conducts socio-technical evaluation on the big data phenomenon to understand the developmental processes through which new practices of thinking and enacting are implemented, embedded, and integrated in South Korea. It also undertakes empirical analyses of user modeling to explore the factors influencing users' adoption of big data by integrating cognitive motivations as well as user values as the primary determining factors. Based on the qualitative and quantitative findings, this study concludes that big data should be developed with user-centered ideas and that users should be the focus of big data design.

Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution.

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects. Some DQ issues exhibit return-s-to-scale effects, and become more or less pronounced in Big Data analytics, though.

If this assumption is not satisfied, we cannot expect a good result of statistical data analysis. Most of statistical methods processing the outlier and noise also need to the assumption. But the assumption is not satisfied in big data because of its large volume and heterogeneity. So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption. In addition, we select patent documents as target domain of big data because patent big data analysis is a important issue in management of technology. We analyze patent documents using big data learning methods for technology analysis. The collected patent data from patent databases on the world are preprocessed and analyzed by text mining and statistics. But the most researches about patent big data analysis did not consider the outlier and noise problem. This problem decreases the accuracy of prediction and increases the variance of parameter estimation. In this paper, we check the existence of the outlier and noise in patent big data. To know whether the outlier is or not in the patent big data, we use box-plot and smoothing visualization. We use the patent documents related to three dimensional printing technology to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be used for finding the existence of noise in the searched patent big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201626360541485,","Title: Big Data ethics, Abstract: The speed of development in Big Data and associated phenomena, such as social media, has surpassed the capacity of the average consumer to understand his or her actions and their knock-on effects.

First, the utilization of big data introduces a novel form of information asymmetry between contracting parties, further empowering the already dominant party while exacerbating the vulnerability of the weaker party.

Big deal: Searching for big data’s performance effects in HR, Abstract: Abstract Big data continues to gather increasing interest in the business press as well as within the management literature. While this interest has spilled over into the realm of human resources (HR) management, solid evidence of its positive performance impacts is lacking. I explore three possibilities for this lack of evidence: (1) HR possesses big data but largely lacks the ability to use it; (2) HR does not actually possess big data; and (3) big data is generating value for HR and positively affects organizational performance, but the winners in the race to utilize big data in HR are not publicizing their successes. Following this, I discuss current forms of big data implementation, highlighting an evolutionary progression of implementations in various settings and emphasizing the importance of balancing deductive with inductive analytical approaches. Finally, I discuss conditions under which big data may hold greater value for the HR function, and I suggest ways managers and organizations can make the most of big data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART112101193,","Title: &#x201e;Massendinghaltung“ oder &#x201e;Big Data“?, Abstract: SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

While this has created enormous new opportunities, it has also created tremendous challenges for national facilities and users. With the huge increase in data volume, the manual analysis of data is no longer possible. As a result, only a fraction of the data collected during the time&#8208; and money&#8208;expensive synchrotron beam&#8208;time is analyzed and used to deliver new science.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;.

However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains.

제조 품질 개선을 위한 식스 시그마 기반 빅데이터 활용 방법의 주요 절차

##서론##
제조 기업의 품질 개선은 오랜 기간 중요한 과제였으며, 이를 위해 식스 시그마와 같은 다양한 품질 개선 방법론이 적용되어 왔습니다. 최근 빅데이터의 유용성이 부각되면서, 방대한 데이터를 활용하여 기존 식스 시그마 방법론의 한계를 극복하고 제조 품질을 더욱 효과적으로 개선하기 위한 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있습니다. 본 문서에서는 제조 품질 개선을 위해 제안된 식스 시그마 기반 빅데이터 활용 방법의 주요 절차를 요약합니다.

##본론##
제조 품질 개선을 위한 식스 시그마 기반 빅데이터 활용 방법은 주로 식스 시그마의 대표적인 문제 해결 프로세스인 DMAIC(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)에 빅데이터 분석 기술을 접목하는 형태로 제안됩니다.

1.  **DMAIC 프로세스 접목**:
    *   **Define (정의)**: 문제 정의 단계에서 빅데이터를 활용하여 개선이 필요한 품질 문제와 목표를 명확히 설정합니다.
    *   **Measure (측정)**: 빅데이터를 통해 제조 공정에서 발생하는 다양한 데이터를 수집하고 측정하여 현재 품질 수준을 파악합니다. 이는 기존 식스 시그마에서 다루기 어려웠던 방대한 양의 데이터(Volume), 다양한 형태의 데이터(Variety), 빠른 속도로 생성되는 데이터(Velocity)를 포함합니다.
    *   **Analyze (분석)**: 수집된 빅데이터를 기반으로 문제의 근본 원인을 분석합니다. 빅데이터 분석 기법(예: 머신러닝, 통계적 분석)을 활용하여 복잡한 공정 파라미터와 품질 특성 간의 숨겨진 상관관계 및 인과관계를 파악하고, 예측 모델을 구축하여 문제 발생 가능성을 예측합니다. 솔라셀 공정 최적화 사례에서는 빅데이터 분석과 6시그마를 접목하여 체계적이고 논리적인 변수 선택 방법론을 제시하고 예측 정확도를 향상시켰습니다.
    *   **Improve (개선)**: 분석 결과를 바탕으로 품질 개선을 위한 최적의 해결책을 도출하고 적용합니다. 빅데이터 분석을 통해 얻은 통찰력을 활용하여 공정 파라미터를 최적화하고 효율성을 높이는 방안을 마련합니다.
    *   **Control (관리)**: 개선된 공정이 지속적으로 유지되도록 관리하고 모니터링합니다. 실시간으로 수집되는 빅데이터를 활용하여 공정의 변화를 감지하고, 이상 징후 발생 시 즉각적으로 대응할 수 있는 시스템을 구축합니다.

2.  **새로운 식스 시그마 프로젝트 실행 방법론**:
    일부 연구에서는 기존 DMAIC의 한계를 보완하기 위해 빅데이터 활용에 특화된 새로운 식스 시그마 프로젝트 실행 방법론을 제안하기도 합니다. 예를 들어, DPELR과 같은 새로운 방법론이 빅데이터 프로젝트를 위한 식스 시그마의 혁신적인 접근 방식으로 소개되기도 합니다. 이러한 새로운 방법론들은 빅데이터의 특성을 더욱 효과적으로 반영하여 품질 개선을 위한 단계별 절차를 제시합니다.

##결론##
제조 품질 개선을 위한 식스 시그마 기반 빅데이터 활용 방법은 기존 식스 시그마의 DMAIC 프로세스에 빅데이터 분석의 강점인 기계학습, 통계적 검증, 수학적 최적화 및 높은 해석력을 결합하여 활용하는 것이 핵심입니다. 이를 통해 방대한 데이터를 효과적으로 분석하고, 문제의 근본 원인을 정확히 파악하며, 예측 정확도를 높여 제조 공정의 효율성과 품질을 획기적으로 개선할 수 있습니다. 이러한 통합된 접근 방식은 스마트 공장 환경에서 발생하는 초 단위 데이터와 같은 대용량 데이터를 처리하고 활용하는 데 필수적이며, 기업의 경쟁력 강화에 크게 기여할 것으로 기대됩니다.",0.6758
Could you summarize how deep learning techniques are envisioned to enhance radar imaging and the main challenges and proposed network architecture discussed?,"##Deep Learning for Radar## ##Introduction## Advances in deep learning offer new opportunities to improve radar imaging beyond traditional automatic target recognition. By integrating neural network models with established radar signal processing, researchers aim to capture complex non-linearities and adaptively compensate for system imperfections. ##Main Body## Deep learning is envisioned to play a central role across a wide range of radar imaging challenges, including synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image formation and autofocus. Key hurdles include the scarcity of labeled radar data, the need to respect the physics of the SAR forward model, and the requirement to mitigate phase errors caused by platform motion. To address these, a hybrid network architecture is proposed that embeds traditional SAR modeling blocks within a deep learning framework: the network learns to approximate the non-linear inversion of the SAR forward operator while leveraging analytic layers for known propagation effects. Additionally, the model is trained to predict and correct trajectory-based phase distortions, improving autofocus performance without relying solely on handcrafted algorithms. ##Conclusion## By combining deep learning’s data-driven learning with established SAR theory, the proposed approach promises enhanced image clarity and robustness to motion errors. Overcoming data limitations and ensuring model fidelity to radar physics are critical for realizing these gains in practical radar systems.",없음,없음,"Title: Deep Learning 프레임워크 성능 비교 연구 : Cloud Computing 환경에서, Abstract: 통신 기술의 발달로 인한 사람과 사람, 장치와 장치, 사람과 장치 간의 연결성의 증가와 저장 매체 기술의 발달, 그리고 데이터 저장 비용의 감소로 인해 데이터의 양이 폭발적으로 증가했다. 이에 따라 다양한 형태의 대규모의 데이터를 빠른 시간 내에 효율적으로 처리할 수 있는 Cloud Computing 기술이 주목 받고 있고, Cloud Computing을 위한 오픈소스 기반의 솔루션 또한 많이 나타나게 되었다. &amp;#xD; 2012년부터 주목받기 시작한 Deep Learning은 전 세계적으로 가장 많은 관심을 받는 연구 분야 중 하나이며, 이중 CNN(Convolution Neural Network)은 가장 대표적 알고리즘이다.

But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery.

Existing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods have shown a certain level of performance, but they have limitations such as cold start, data sparseness, and lack of long-term pattern learning. In this study, we design a matching system that combines a hybrid recommendation system and hyper-personalization technology and propose an efficient recommendation system. The core of the study is to develop a recommendation model that can improve recommendation accuracy and increase user satisfaction compared to existing systems. The proposed elements are as follows. First, the hybrid-hyper-personalization matching system provides recommendation accuracy compared to existing methods.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Imaging of Ischemic Stroke, Abstract: Timely analysis of imaging data is critical for diagnosis and decision-making for proper treatment strategy in the cases of ischemic stroke.

But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures.

##Introduction##
Deep learning techniques are increasingly being leveraged to significantly advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging. This approach offers a vision for improving various aspects of radar systems, from image quality and target recognition to signal processing and environmental compensation. By exploiting the powerful capabilities of deep neural networks, researchers aim to overcome limitations inherent in traditional radar methods.

##Main Body##
**Enhancements Envisioned through Deep Learning:**
Deep learning is envisioned to enhance radar imaging in several key areas:
*   **Improved Image Quality and Reconstruction:** Deep learning can advance the state-of-the-art in radar imaging by capturing the non-linearity of the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) forward model and providing better shape reconstruction of targets with less under-sampled data. It can also improve imaging efficiency and produce focused, high-contrast imagery, even in passive SAR systems where transmitter information is unknown. For MIMO radar, deep learning can effectively suppress mutual coupling interference caused by non-orthogonal waveforms, thereby improving imaging quality.
*   **Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) and Classification:** Deep learning algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), are applied to ATR based on high range resolution profiles (HRRPs), Doppler signatures, and SAR images. They are also crucial for radar emitter identification, enabling accurate classification of complicated patterns in radar signals and discriminating threat types in electronic warfare.
*   **Compensation and Correction:** Deep learning can learn and compensate for trajectory-based phase errors, addressing the autofocus problem in SAR systems. It can also be used for radar jamming/clutter recognition and suppression, and for compensating phase errors due to non-ideal platform paths or unstable attitudes during SAR data acquisition.
*   **Signal Processing and System Design:** Applications extend to radar waveform and antenna array design, passive or low probability of interception (LPI) radar waveform recognition, and cognitive radar antenna selection to optimize subarrays for signal transmission and reception based on environmental changes. Deep learning also shows promise in radar-based convective storm nowcasting, improving prediction skills.

**Main Challenges Discussed:**
Despite the significant potential, several challenges are associated with applying deep learning to radar imaging:
*   **Data Limitations:** A primary challenge is the requirement for large amounts of training data. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) often face limiting factors due to insufficient training samples.
*   **Model Complexity and Interpretability:** The increasing complexity and non-linearity of deep learning models can turn them into ""black boxes,"" leading to a lack of reliability and interpretability of their results, which is a concern for real-world clinical or critical applications.
*   **Computational Efficiency:** While deep learning can improve imaging efficiency in some cases, the computational efficiency of image reconstruction algorithms can still be a limiting factor, especially when dealing with sparse representations.
*   **Environmental Factors and Noise:** Radar systems operate in complex electromagnetic environments with diverse signal features. Traditional methods have limitations in these scenarios, and deep learning models need to be robust against noise generation and environmental influences. Issues like serious coupling noise from non-orthogonal waveforms and phase errors from unstable platforms need to be addressed.
*   **Adversarial Examples:** The vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial examples is another limiting factor affecting real-life performance.
*   **Spatial Smoothing:** In applications like rainfall prediction, CNN models may exhibit spatial smoothing, limiting their accuracy for strong rainfall areas or detailed rainfall predictions.

**Proposed Network Architectures:**
Various network architectures have been proposed to address these challenges and harness deep learning's capabilities:
*   **SAR-Specific Architectures:** A general approach involves designing network architectures based on the specific structure of the SAR imaging problem, augmenting learning with traditional SAR modeling to capture non-linearity.
*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Auto-encoders:** Deep RNNs are proposed as inverse solvers, parameterized by transmitted waveforms. These can be cascaded with a decoder stage to form recurrent auto-encoder architectures, suitable for unsupervised training and problems where the forward model is partially known (e.g., passive SAR).
*   **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** CNNs are widely used, including U-Net and SegNet based structures for tasks like short-term rainfall prediction and object detection. An improved EfficientNetv2-s classification method, which replaces 2D convolution with 1D and optimizes the channel attention mechanism, has been proposed for radar spectrum image classification.
*   **Complex-Value Deep Neural Networks (CV-DNNs):** These are used for Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging to perform image formation using under-sampled data, effectively extracting and exploiting sparse features through multilayer non-linear processing.
*   **Deep Imaging Networks:** For MIMO radar imaging with non-orthogonal waveforms, deep imaging networks are constructed to learn the mapping relationship between radar echoes and ideal target images, suppressing coupling interference.
*   **Unsupervised Image-to-image Translation (UNIT) Networks:** Proposed for deep learning-based motion compensation in millimeter-wave radar imaging to correct phase errors.
*   **Multi-output DL Networks:** For autonomous driving applications, a single DL network structure can classify objects (vehicles, cyclists, pedestrians) and simultaneously estimate their movement directions using 4D imaging radar data.
*   **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs):** General DNNs are applied for radar emitter classification and identification.

"Can you provide a concise overview of the comparison between deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for complex image analysis, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses?","##Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning for Complex Image Analysis## ##Introduction## Complex image analysis tasks—such as histopathological slide interpretation—require powerful feature extraction to support accurate diagnosis. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have driven major advances in segmentation, detection, and tumor classification, but they depend on large, well‐annotated datasets and often lose spatial context when applied patchwise. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as an alternative that learns policies to navigate and analyze images without exhaustive annotations, potentially preserving contextual information. ##Main Body## Deep learning excels at hierarchical feature learning and benefits from mature frameworks and GPU acceleration; however, it struggles with gigabyte‐scale images, adversarial input variations, and the patch‐based multi‐instance learning (MIL) approach’s tendency to fragment context. DRL formulates image analysis as a sequential decision problem, enabling models to selectively attend to informative regions and learn from limited data while maintaining spatial coherence. This reinforcement approach reduces reliance on localized labels and mitigates data scarcity, though it demands careful reward function design and often incurs greater computational cost during training. ##Conclusion## While deep learning remains the primary choice for segmentation and classification when plentiful annotated data exist, deep reinforcement learning offers a promising complement in scenarios with limited labels and extremely large images, preserving contextual integrity and enabling more adaptive feature extraction.",없음,없음,"Title: Deep Learning 프레임워크 성능 비교 연구 : Cloud Computing 환경에서, Abstract: 통신 기술의 발달로 인한 사람과 사람, 장치와 장치, 사람과 장치 간의 연결성의 증가와 저장 매체 기술의 발달, 그리고 데이터 저장 비용의 감소로 인해 데이터의 양이 폭발적으로 증가했다. 이에 따라 다양한 형태의 대규모의 데이터를 빠른 시간 내에 효율적으로 처리할 수 있는 Cloud Computing 기술이 주목 받고 있고, Cloud Computing을 위한 오픈소스 기반의 솔루션 또한 많이 나타나게 되었다. &amp;#xD; 2012년부터 주목받기 시작한 Deep Learning은 전 세계적으로 가장 많은 관심을 받는 연구 분야 중 하나이며, 이중 CNN(Convolution Neural Network)은 가장 대표적 알고리즘이다.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002574280,","Title: Deep Learning 기반의 폐기물 선별 Vision 시스템 개발, Abstract: Recently, with the development of industry and the improvement of living standards, various wastes are generated along with the production of various products.

But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery.

Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications.

We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002787934,","Title: A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis, Abstract: The image analysis is an important and predominant task for classifying the different parts of the image. The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871,","Title: Affective Computing Among Individuals in Deep Learning, Abstract: This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently. Especially, I am talking about emotional computing that has been mentioned a lot recently during deep learning.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Imaging of Ischemic Stroke, Abstract: Timely analysis of imaging data is critical for diagnosis and decision-making for proper treatment strategy in the cases of ischemic stroke.

A key feature is that high-performance computing device, especially CUDA-enabled GPU, supports this trend. Researchers who have difficulty accessing such systems fall behind in this fast-changing trend.

This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003088774,","Title: Enhancing Smart Grid Anomaly Detection Through Deep Learning, Abstract: The modernization of power grids into smart grids introduces numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003160214",21,1.1859924140007934,row_000022,"Title: A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis

Deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are two prominent artificial intelligence paradigms increasingly applied to complex image analysis. While both leverage deep neural networks, they differ fundamentally in their learning approaches and, consequently, in their strengths and weaknesses when tackling intricate image-related tasks. This overview will highlight these comparative aspects.

##Main Body##
**Deep Learning (DL) for Complex Image Analysis**

**Strengths:**
*   **High Performance with Large Data:** Deep learning methods, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel in tasks involving vast amounts of digital data. They have shown remarkable improvements in areas such as image reconstruction, quality enhancement, parameter mapping, contrast conversion, and image segmentation.
*   **Effective Feature Extraction and Classification:** DL is highly effective in extracting features from images, enabling robust image classification, object detection, and tumor diagnosis. It can also achieve superior performance in recognizing subtle movements in motion classification tasks.
*   **Image Enhancement and Understanding:** DL techniques can significantly improve the visual quality of images by enhancing definition, enriching texture details, and reducing noise. They also contribute to image understanding and, in some cases, text generation from images.
*   **Transfer Learning:** DL models can be effectively adapted to new tasks with limited data through transfer learning, leveraging knowledge gained from large general datasets.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Data Dependency:** A significant limitation is the requirement for a large quantity of sufficient, high-quality training examples, especially for specialized medical image datasets.
*   **Annotation Challenges:** Feature extraction from the entire image area and obtaining precise ground truth localized annotations can be challenging and labor-intensive.
*   **Scalability Issues:** Handling extremely large digital pathological slides (in gigabytes) and the adversarial effects of input representations pose considerable challenges.
*   **Loss of Contextual Information:** When complex images, such as histopathological images, are divided into high-resolution patches for analysis (e.g., in Multi-Instance Learning), DL can suffer from a loss of contextual and spatial information.
*   **Interpretability and Robustness:** DL models can be ""black boxes,"" lacking transparency and interpretability, which limits their reliability in critical applications like clinical diagnosis. They can also be sensitive to labeling accuracy and class imbalance in datasets, and may cause structural distortion if training and input image features differ significantly.
*   **Computational Cost:** Optimizing network structures often requires substantial computing power and extensive trial-and-error.

**Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for Complex Image Analysis**

**Strengths:**
*   **Learning from Limited Data and Context Preservation:** DRL techniques can learn features from limited data without losing contextual and spatial information, addressing a key weakness of traditional DL in certain complex image analysis scenarios.
*   **Sequential Decision-Making:** DRL excels in tasks requiring sequential decision-making, such as image hashing where it learns each hashing function by correcting previous errors to improve retrieval accuracy. It can also be applied to object tracking by generating action sequences to update target locations, leading to improved accuracy, speed, and robustness.
*   **Adaptability and Autonomy:** DRL algorithms show improvements in performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency. They can autonomously propose solutions and optimize models when resource data does not match the existing model, and can adapt to complex scenarios like partial observability and multi-agent interactions.
*   **Time-Series Data Learning:** DRL agents can effectively learn time-series data, such as human motion acceleration data, achieving comparable accuracy to deep neural networks with less data.
*   **Integration of Perception and Decision-Making:** DRL effectively combines the perceptual capabilities of deep learning with the decision-making abilities of reinforcement learning, making it suitable for complex control and optimization problems in image analysis.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Maturity and Comparison:** DRL is a newer and emerging technique compared to traditional deep learning, meaning there has been less effort dedicated to direct comparisons and established best practices for image analysis.
*   **Training Efficiency and Stability:** Traditional DRL structures, such as Dueling Deep Q-Networks (DQN), can suffer from low training efficiency and instability.
*   **Generalization Challenges:** A critical limitation of DRL is its struggle with generalizing learned strategies to entirely unseen scenarios, which can hinder its scalability in diverse applications.
*   **Overestimation and Reward Function Dependency:** Certain DRL algorithms, like DQN, can suffer from overestimation problems. Additionally, the reliance on carefully designed reward functions can limit the adaptability of DRL agents to new or changing environments.

##Conclusion##
In summary, deep learning offers robust capabilities for feature extraction, classification, and enhancement in image analysis, particularly with abundant data. However, it faces challenges with data scarcity, contextual information loss, and interpretability. Deep reinforcement learning, while newer, provides a powerful alternative for scenarios requiring sequential decision-making, learning from limited data while preserving context, and adapting to dynamic environments. Its weaknesses lie in its relative immaturity, potential training instabilities, and generalization difficulties. The choice between DL and DRL, or a hybrid approach, depends heavily on the specific nature of the complex image analysis task, the availability of data, and the need for autonomous decision-making.",0.6758
"Could you briefly summarize the methodology and results of using CNN, LSTM, and SVM combinations for noninvasive diabetes detection based on HRV signals?","##Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms## ##Introduction## Heart rate variability (HRV) extracted from ECG signals provides a noninvasive window into autonomic function and has shown promise for early diabetes screening. Leveraging advances in deep learning, this study explores how convolutional and recurrent neural networks can capture complex temporal dynamics in HRV data to distinguish diabetic from healthy subjects. ##Main Body## The methodology combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks—either standalone or in tandem—to learn spatial and temporal features from RR-interval sequences. These learned representations are then fed into a support vector machine (SVM) classifier, which refines decision boundaries between normal and diabetic patterns. Incorporating SVM on top of CNN and CNN-LSTM models yields incremental performance gains of 0.03% and 0.06%, respectively, over architectures without SVM. Overall, the hybrid framework achieves a classification accuracy of 95.7%, demonstrating robustness in noninvasive diabetes detection. ##Conclusion## By fusing CNN- and LSTM-based feature extraction with SVM classification, the proposed approach attains high diagnostic accuracy on HRV data, offering a practical and precise tool for early, noninvasive diabetes detection.",없음,없음,"Title: Deep Learning 프레임워크 성능 비교 연구 : Cloud Computing 환경에서, Abstract: 통신 기술의 발달로 인한 사람과 사람, 장치와 장치, 사람과 장치 간의 연결성의 증가와 저장 매체 기술의 발달, 그리고 데이터 저장 비용의 감소로 인해 데이터의 양이 폭발적으로 증가했다. 이에 따라 다양한 형태의 대규모의 데이터를 빠른 시간 내에 효율적으로 처리할 수 있는 Cloud Computing 기술이 주목 받고 있고, Cloud Computing을 위한 오픈소스 기반의 솔루션 또한 많이 나타나게 되었다. &amp;#xD; 2012년부터 주목받기 시작한 Deep Learning은 전 세계적으로 가장 많은 관심을 받는 연구 분야 중 하나이며, 이중 CNN(Convolution Neural Network)은 가장 대표적 알고리즘이다.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002574280,","Title: Deep Learning 기반의 폐기물 선별 Vision 시스템 개발, Abstract: Recently, with the development of industry and the improvement of living standards, various wastes are generated along with the production of various products.

But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery.

Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures.

Studies implementing deep learning in the dental field were searched, identified, and extracted from the electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus). Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002967457,","Title: Deep learning, Abstract: Artificial intelligence is one of the most beautiful dreams of mankind.

A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002787934,","Title: A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis, Abstract: The image analysis is an important and predominant task for classifying the different parts of the image. The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871,","Title: Affective Computing Among Individuals in Deep Learning, Abstract: This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Imaging of Ischemic Stroke, Abstract: Timely analysis of imaging data is critical for diagnosis and decision-making for proper treatment strategy in the cases of ischemic stroke.

This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003088774,","Title: Enhancing Smart Grid Anomaly Detection Through Deep Learning, Abstract: The modernization of power grids into smart grids introduces numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003160214",22,1.1859924140007934,row_000023,"Title: Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms

##Introduction##
The early and non-invasive detection of diabetes is critical for effective treatment and preventing severe complications. Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals, derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, have been identified as a valuable resource for this purpose. Recent research has focused on leveraging advanced deep learning architectures, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and their synergistic combinations with Support Vector Machines (SVM), to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of diabetes detection based on HRV signals.

##Main Body##
**Methodology:**
The general methodology for noninvasive diabetes detection using CNN, LSTM, and SVM combinations based on HRV signals involves several key steps:

1.  **Data Acquisition:** RR-interval signals, known as Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals, are typically derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. These signals serve as the primary input data for the detection system.
2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, either individually or in hybrid architectures (CNN-LSTM), are employed to extract complex temporal dynamic features from the raw HRV data. Some deep learning techniques, particularly CNN and CNN-LSTM, are noted for their ability to automatically learn and extract relevant features, thereby bypassing the need for conventional, manual feature engineering.
    *   In specific hybrid CNN-LSTM models, the CNN component, consisting of convolution and max-pooling layers, is primarily responsible for extracting spatial features. The output of these layers is then fed into the LSTM layer.
    *   For CNN-SVM combinations, the feature vectors obtained from the CNN's full connection layer are utilized as input for the subsequent SVM classifier.
3.  **Classification:**
    *   The features extracted by the deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, or CNN-LSTM combinations) are then passed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the final classification task. The SVM acts as a robust classifier, distinguishing between diabetic and normal HRV signals.
    *   In some CNN-LSTM architectures, the LSTM layer itself performs the classification after receiving the features extracted by the CNN.

**Results:**
Studies employing these combined methodologies have reported high accuracy rates for non-invasive diabetes detection:

*   One research paper presented a classification system that achieved a very high accuracy of **95.7%** for diagnosing diabetes using ECG-derived HRV signals. This system utilized LSTM, CNN, and their combinations for feature extraction, with these features subsequently passed to an SVM for classification. The study noted performance improvements of 0.03% for CNN and 0.06% for CNN-LSTM architectures when SVM was incorporated, compared to earlier work without SVM.
*   Another study focused on automated diabetes detection using CNN and CNN-LSTM networks with heart rate signals. It reported a maximum accuracy of **90.9%** for test data using the CNN-LSTM combination. When evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation, the CNN alone achieved 93.6% accuracy, while the CNN-LSTM combination yielded a maximum accuracy of **95.1%**. This was highlighted as the highest accuracy achieved for automated diabetes detection using HRV at the time.
*   Hybrid CNN-LSTM models are generally recognized for their ""good performance"" in predicting diabetes, demonstrating effectiveness in extracting hidden features and correlations from physiological variables.
*   An approach for diabetes data anomaly detection, which combined hierarchical clustering and SVM, and utilized CNN for data analysis and feature extraction for the SVM, showed ""better performance"" compared to other machine learning algorithms such as random forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and standalone SVM.

##Conclusion##
The integration of CNN, LSTM, and SVM techniques provides a powerful and accurate framework for the non-invasive detection of diabetes using HRV signals. These hybrid models effectively leverage the strengths of deep learning for automatic and intricate feature extraction (CNN for spatial patterns, LSTM for temporal dynamics) and the robust classification capabilities of SVM. The reported high accuracy rates, reaching up to 95.7% and 95.1% in various studies, underscore the significant potential of these combined approaches to assist clinicians in the early and precise diagnosis of diabetes.",0.6758

Time-series prediction remains a challenge, prompting comparison between traditional statistical methods and modern deep learning architectures. ##Main Body## Three models were tested on German home appliance power-consumption data: - An error-corrected multilayer perceptron (eMLP), which combines a standard MLP with an error-correction mechanism. - An autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, representing a classical statistical approach. - A hybrid convolutional neural network–long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network, designed to extract spatial patterns via convolution layers and capture temporal dependencies through LSTM units. Performance was evaluated using mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The CNN-LSTM achieved the lowest MSE and MAPE, significantly outperforming eMLP, which in turn outperformed ARIMA. ##Conclusion## The CNN-LSTM architecture demonstrated superior accuracy in electricity demand forecasting, highlighting the benefit of combining convolutional feature extraction with recurrent temporal modeling over both pure neural networks and traditional time-series methods.",없음,없음,"Title: Deep Learning 프레임워크 성능 비교 연구 : Cloud Computing 환경에서, Abstract: 통신 기술의 발달로 인한 사람과 사람, 장치와 장치, 사람과 장치 간의 연결성의 증가와 저장 매체 기술의 발달, 그리고 데이터 저장 비용의 감소로 인해 데이터의 양이 폭발적으로 증가했다. 이에 따라 다양한 형태의 대규모의 데이터를 빠른 시간 내에 효율적으로 처리할 수 있는 Cloud Computing 기술이 주목 받고 있고, Cloud Computing을 위한 오픈소스 기반의 솔루션 또한 많이 나타나게 되었다. &amp;#xD; 2012년부터 주목받기 시작한 Deep Learning은 전 세계적으로 가장 많은 관심을 받는 연구 분야 중 하나이며, 이중 CNN(Convolution Neural Network)은 가장 대표적 알고리즘이다.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002574280,","Title: Deep Learning 기반의 폐기물 선별 Vision 시스템 개발, Abstract: Recently, with the development of industry and the improvement of living standards, various wastes are generated along with the production of various products.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002638568,","Title: Gamification for Education of Deep Learning, Abstract: In this study, we introduced a test platform of gamification, based on Unity-Agents, for education of deep learning.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003008557,","Title: Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms, Abstract: Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002424231,","Title: Deep Learning in Dentistry: A Literature Review, Abstract: The aim of this literature review is to investigate current application and diagnostic performance of AI in the dental field, address their limitations, and suggest possible future applications to AI in dentistry. Studies implementing deep learning in the dental field were searched, identified, and extracted from the electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus). Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002967457,","Title: Deep learning, Abstract: Artificial intelligence is one of the most beautiful dreams of mankind.

A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002787934,","Title: A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis, Abstract: The image analysis is an important and predominant task for classifying the different parts of the image. The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871,","Title: Affective Computing Among Individuals in Deep Learning, Abstract: This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field.

But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures.

##Conclusion##
The evaluation of deep learning and machine learning models for electricity demand prediction reveals a diverse landscape of approaches. Deep learning models, particularly variants of LSTM and hybrid architectures like CNN-LSTM and Hybrid Gated Fusion models, frequently demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy (lower MSE/RMSE and MAPE) compared to traditional machine learning and statistical methods like ARIMA, SVM, and Random Forest. For instance, CNN-LSTM consistently outperformed eMLP and ARIMA, while specific LSTM and WaveNet configurations achieved MAPE values as low as 1.33% and 2.74% respectively. XGBoost also showed strong performance for peak power prediction with a low RMSE of 0.018. The choice of model often depends on the specific characteristics of the data (e.g., overall vs. special days, inclusion of external factors like temperature) and the prediction horizon.",0.6758

HCI의 대표적인 기술 중 하나는 사용자 감정 인식이다. 감정의 중요성이 증대됨에 따라, 사용자의 감정을 인식하기 위해 얼굴 표정, 제스처, 음성신호, 생리신호, 안구특징 및 멀티 모달리티 (Multi-Modality) 신호를 특징으로 사용하는 방법들이 제안되고 있다. &amp;#xD; 특히, 안구 특징은 사용자가 의도적으로 제어할 수 없으며 컴퓨터가 무의식적인 특징들을 인식할 수 있기 때문에 감정인식에 적합하다. 또한 다양한 분야에 적용될 것으로 기대되는 가상현실과 증강현실을 위해 안구 특징에 기반한 감정인식 기술이 연구되어야 한다.&amp;#xD; 합성곱 신경망 (CNN)과 재귀 신경망 (RNN)과 같은 심층 학습 (Deep learning) 기술들이 다양한 분야에서 성공하고 있으며, 다양한 모달리티들을 이용하는 감정인식 연구에 적용되고 있다. 그러나 다른 모달리티들과 달리, 안구 특징만을 사용하는 심층 학습기반의 감정인식 연구는 매우 부족하다.&amp;#xD; 본 학위논문에서는 시간정보와 동공 크기와 눈 움직임 신호와 같은 안구 특징들만을 이용한 심층 학습 기반의 감정인식 방법을 제안한다.&amp;#xD; 그 과정은 다음과 같다. 먼저, 눈 깜빡임 또는 기술적인 결함으로 인해 발생되는 눈 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 데이터 미획득 구간을 채우기 위한 보간을 수행한다. 그 후 데이터의 길이와 범위를 일치시키기 위해, 신호의 시간과 각 피실험자의 신호들에 대해 정규화를 수행한다. 다음으로 동공 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 시간과 주파수 정보를 분석하기 위해 Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) 특징들을 추출하고, 그 특징들을 결합하여 STFT 특징 결합 영상이라 불리우는 단일 이미지를 생성한다. 마지막으로, valence-arousal 인식을 수행하기 위해, STFT 특징 결합 영상에 적합한 심층 학습 모델을 생성한 후 leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) 방법을 이용하여 제안하는 방법의 성능을 평가한다. &amp;#xD; 대부분의 연구에서, 안구 특징은 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 성능을 향상시키기 위한 보조정보로만 사용하고 있다. 이는 안구 특징이 자극에 민감하고 수동적인 특징 추출방법으로 양질의 특징을 추출하기 어려운 많은 이상치 (Outlier)들을 포함하기 때문이다. 그러나 제안하는 방법의 분류 정확도는 Soleymani [53]가 제안한 결정 수준 융합 (DLF)와 서포트 벡터 머신 (SVM)을 이용한 방법보다 valence와 arousal 감정에 대해 각각 23.6%, 9.8% 향상된 분류 정확도를 달성하였다.&amp;#xD; 실험결과는 제안하는 방법의 효과성을 입증하였고, CNN 모델이 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 방법뿐만 아니라 안구 특징 기반 감정인식에도 효과적이며, 눈 움직임 정보가 valence 감정 인식에도 효과적임을 보였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0014668242,","Title: 딥 러닝 기반 머리 포즈 추정 및 얼굴 특징점 정렬에 관한 연구, Abstract: 컴퓨터 비전은 어떤 영상에서 장면이나 특징을 인식하는 분야로 근본적인 목적은 입체를 인식하거나 영상 내의 객체를 인식, 또는 객체 간의 관계를 이해하는 것이다. 1982년 D.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis.

The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information.

But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'. In addition learning strategies are associated with learning motivation. Students with 'meaning orientation' who struggle for deep learning, are intrinsically motivated, whereas students with 'reproduction orientation' or 'achieving orientation' are extrinsically motivated. Therefore, to foster active learning and intrinsic motivation of students, it isn't enough to just teach how to learn.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002638568,","Title: Gamification for Education of Deep Learning, Abstract: In this study, we introduced a test platform of gamification, based on Unity-Agents, for education of deep learning.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003008557,","Title: Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms, Abstract: Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002424231,","Title: Deep Learning in Dentistry: A Literature Review, Abstract: The aim of this literature review is to investigate current application and diagnostic performance of AI in the dental field, address their limitations, and suggest possible future applications to AI in dentistry.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871,","Title: Affective Computing Among Individuals in Deep Learning, Abstract: This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently.

##Introduction##
Over the past decade, deep learning has been a pivotal force, triggering the third artificial intelligence boom. Systematic analyses, primarily utilizing LDA-based topic modeling, have been conducted to understand the evolving research landscape of deep learning, including identifying distinct trends and country-specific differences among major research nations such as China, the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom.

##Main Body##
Topic modeling analyses of deep learning research over the past ten years reveal several key trends and areas of focus:

*   **Broad Application Areas:** Deep learning research has spanned a wide array of fields. Early analyses (1990-2017) identified twenty major topics including classification accuracy, optimization problems, time series models, image features, control systems, energy power, and applications in healthcare (e.g., cancer patients) and fault diagnosis. These topics were consistently identified as ""hot"" research areas.
*   **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Advancements:** Recent trends in DRL show significant improvements in algorithms concerning performance, learning stability, and computational efficiency. DRL's application has expanded to multi-agent reinforcement learning and diverse domains such as robotics, natural language processing, computer vision, finance, healthcare, chemistry, and art.
*   **Intelligent Information Technologies:** In national R&D projects related to AI, key research topics include artificial intelligence itself, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) as core intelligent information technologies. A notable emerging trend in this area is research on hyper-realistic media.
*   **AI Patent and News Trends:** Analysis of AI technical patents indicates ""artificial intelligence, algorithms, and 5G"" as prominent ""hot"" topics. Concurrently, AI news reports tend to focus on ""industrial application, data utilization, and market application."" Conversely, research centered on ""systems and hardware technology"" has shown a declining trend.
*   **Specific Methodologies and Applications:** Deep learning methods are increasingly applied in MR image processing for tasks such as image reconstruction, image quality improvement, parameter mapping, image contrast conversion, and image segmentation. Furthermore, deep learning has been reviewed for its role in feature extraction and recognition of radar target characteristics in Radar Automatic Target Recognition (RATR).

**Country-Specific Differences:**
While a general study identified differences among China, the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom in deep learning research trends, more specific details emerge from other analyses:

*   **China:** Deep learning development in China is characterized by applications in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. China has seen an ""explosion"" in AI patent filings between 2008 and 2018, surpassing the United States. In terms of AI technology, research and development in ""visual understanding, data analysis, motion control, and machine learning"" are more active than in ""language understanding and speech processing."" China is also actively promoting advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) research.
*   **South Korea (and International Comparison):** In the context of public data research, South Korea primarily focuses on ""public sector policy research,"" with increasing trends in ""personal information protection,"" ""public data management,"" and ""urban environment."" In contrast, international public data research shows a higher prevalence of ""medical and health-related research,"" with ""urban policy,"" ""cell biology,"" ""deep learning,"" and ""cloud·security"" being active areas.

##Conclusion##
The past decade has seen deep learning evolve rapidly, with topic modeling analyses highlighting its pervasive influence across various scientific and engineering domains. Key trends include the maturation of Deep Reinforcement Learning, the integration of deep learning with intelligent information technologies like big data and IoT, and its application in specialized areas such as medical imaging and radar systems. Country-specific analyses reveal distinct national priorities and growth patterns, with China demonstrating a remarkable surge in AI patents and a focus on visual understanding and data analysis, while South Korea shows a strong emphasis on public sector policy research in its public data initiatives, contrasting with a broader international focus on medical and health-related applications. These findings offer valuable insights for future research directions and strategic development in the field of deep learning.",0.6758

HCI의 대표적인 기술 중 하나는 사용자 감정 인식이다. 감정의 중요성이 증대됨에 따라, 사용자의 감정을 인식하기 위해 얼굴 표정, 제스처, 음성신호, 생리신호, 안구특징 및 멀티 모달리티 (Multi-Modality) 신호를 특징으로 사용하는 방법들이 제안되고 있다. &amp;#xD; 특히, 안구 특징은 사용자가 의도적으로 제어할 수 없으며 컴퓨터가 무의식적인 특징들을 인식할 수 있기 때문에 감정인식에 적합하다. 또한 다양한 분야에 적용될 것으로 기대되는 가상현실과 증강현실을 위해 안구 특징에 기반한 감정인식 기술이 연구되어야 한다.&amp;#xD; 합성곱 신경망 (CNN)과 재귀 신경망 (RNN)과 같은 심층 학습 (Deep learning) 기술들이 다양한 분야에서 성공하고 있으며, 다양한 모달리티들을 이용하는 감정인식 연구에 적용되고 있다. 그러나 다른 모달리티들과 달리, 안구 특징만을 사용하는 심층 학습기반의 감정인식 연구는 매우 부족하다.&amp;#xD; 본 학위논문에서는 시간정보와 동공 크기와 눈 움직임 신호와 같은 안구 특징들만을 이용한 심층 학습 기반의 감정인식 방법을 제안한다.&amp;#xD; 그 과정은 다음과 같다. 먼저, 눈 깜빡임 또는 기술적인 결함으로 인해 발생되는 눈 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 데이터 미획득 구간을 채우기 위한 보간을 수행한다. 그 후 데이터의 길이와 범위를 일치시키기 위해, 신호의 시간과 각 피실험자의 신호들에 대해 정규화를 수행한다. 다음으로 동공 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 시간과 주파수 정보를 분석하기 위해 Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) 특징들을 추출하고, 그 특징들을 결합하여 STFT 특징 결합 영상이라 불리우는 단일 이미지를 생성한다. 마지막으로, valence-arousal 인식을 수행하기 위해, STFT 특징 결합 영상에 적합한 심층 학습 모델을 생성한 후 leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) 방법을 이용하여 제안하는 방법의 성능을 평가한다. &amp;#xD; 대부분의 연구에서, 안구 특징은 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 성능을 향상시키기 위한 보조정보로만 사용하고 있다. 이는 안구 특징이 자극에 민감하고 수동적인 특징 추출방법으로 양질의 특징을 추출하기 어려운 많은 이상치 (Outlier)들을 포함하기 때문이다. 그러나 제안하는 방법의 분류 정확도는 Soleymani [53]가 제안한 결정 수준 융합 (DLF)와 서포트 벡터 머신 (SVM)을 이용한 방법보다 valence와 arousal 감정에 대해 각각 23.6%, 9.8% 향상된 분류 정확도를 달성하였다.&amp;#xD; 실험결과는 제안하는 방법의 효과성을 입증하였고, CNN 모델이 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 방법뿐만 아니라 안구 특징 기반 감정인식에도 효과적이며, 눈 움직임 정보가 valence 감정 인식에도 효과적임을 보였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0014668242,","Title: 딥 러닝 기반 머리 포즈 추정 및 얼굴 특징점 정렬에 관한 연구, Abstract: 컴퓨터 비전은 어떤 영상에서 장면이나 특징을 인식하는 분야로 근본적인 목적은 입체를 인식하거나 영상 내의 객체를 인식, 또는 객체 간의 관계를 이해하는 것이다. 1982년 D.

The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002574280,","Title: Deep Learning 기반의 폐기물 선별 Vision 시스템 개발, Abstract: Recently, with the development of industry and the improvement of living standards, various wastes are generated along with the production of various products. Most of these wastes are used as containers for products, and plastic or aluminum is used. Various attempts are being made to automate the classification of these wastes due to the high labor cost, but most of them are solved by manpower due to the geometrical shape change due to the nature of the waste. In this study, in order to automate the waste sorting task, Deep Learning technology is applied to a robot system for waste sorting and a vision system for waste sorting to effectively perform sorting tasks according to the shape of waste. As a result of the experiment, a Deep Learning parameter suitable for waste sorting was selected. In addition, through various experiments, it was confirmed that 99% of wastes could be selected in individual & group image learning.

Today, demands for teaching how to learn increase, because there is a lot of complex material which is delivered to students. But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'. In addition learning strategies are associated with learning motivation. Students with 'meaning orientation' who struggle for deep learning, are intrinsically motivated, whereas students with 'reproduction orientation' or 'achieving orientation' are extrinsically motivated. Therefore, to foster active learning and intrinsic motivation of students, it isn't enough to just teach how to learn. Changes of curriculum and assessment methods, that stimulate deep learning and curiosity of students are needed with educators and learners working cooperatively., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO200923354858103,","Title: Deep Learning을 기반으로 한 Feature Extraction 알고리즘의 분석, Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence related technologies including machine learning are being applied to various fields, and the demand is also increasing.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002638568,","Title: Gamification for Education of Deep Learning, Abstract: In this study, we introduced a test platform of gamification, based on Unity-Agents, for education of deep learning.

At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO.

Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002424231,","Title: Deep Learning in Dentistry: A Literature Review, Abstract: The aim of this literature review is to investigate current application and diagnostic performance of AI in the dental field, address their limitations, and suggest possible future applications to AI in dentistry.

The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003160214",25,1.1859924140007934,row_000026,"Title: Deep Learning 프레임워크 성능 비교 연구 : Cloud Computing 환경에서

클라우드 컴퓨팅 환경에서 오픈소스 딥 러닝 프레임워크 성능 비교 결과 및 그 의의

##서론##
클라우드 컴퓨팅 환경에서 딥 러닝 기술의 활용이 증가함에 따라, 다양한 오픈소스 딥 러닝 프레임워크들 간의 성능 비교 연구가 중요해지고 있습니다. 이러한 연구는 특정 환경에서 어떤 프레임워크가 더 효율적인지 파악하고, 개발자들이 최적의 도구를 선택하는 데 필요한 객관적인 정보를 제공합니다. 본 보고서는 클라우드 환경에서 주요 오픈소스 딥 러닝 프레임워크들의 성능 비교 결과와 그 의의를 간결하게 정리합니다.

##본론##
클라우드 컴퓨팅 환경에서 주로 비교 연구되는 오픈소스 딥 러닝 프레임워크로는 Google의 TensorFlow, Facebook의 PyTorch, Microsoft의 CNTK, Theano, Keras, Caffe, DeepSpark, SparkNet, R 등이 있습니다. 이들 프레임워크에 대한 성능 비교 결과는 다음과 같습니다.

*   **TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK 비교:** 여러 벤치마크 데이터셋(이미지 처리, 자연어 처리 등)을 활용한 정성적 및 정량적 비교 연구에서 CNTK가 대부분의 실험에서 다른 프레임워크보다 우수한 구현 성능을 보였습니다. 코딩 편의성 측면에서는 Theano가 가장 어려웠으며, CNTK와 TensorFlow는 유사하게 추상화되어 있었으나 가중치와 편향을 직접 정의하는 방식에서 차이를 보였습니다. 실행 속도에서는 큰 차이가 없었지만, CNN 모델에 국한된 실험에서는 TensorFlow가 Theano보다 약간 빠른 것으로 나타났습니다.
*   **DeepSpark, SparkNet (스파크 기반 분산 환경) 비교:** 아파치 스파크 기반 클러스터 컴퓨팅 프레임워크 상에서 딥 러닝을 분산화하는 두 가지 툴인 DeepSpark와 SparkNet의 성능을 학습 정확도와 속도 측면에서 분석한 결과, DeepSpark는 학습 초기 정확도 변동 폭이 컸지만 점차 줄어들면서 SparkNet 대비 약 15% 높은 정확도를 보였습니다. 또한, 조건에 따라 단일 머신보다도 높은 정확도로 더 빠르게 수렴하는 양상을 확인했습니다.
*   **TensorFlow, PyTorch (이미지 학습) 비교:** 이미지 학습 분야에서 가장 많이 사용되는 TensorFlow와 PyTorch 프레임워크를 활용하여 이미지 학습을 진행하고 그 결과를 비교 분석하여 최적화된 프레임워크를 도출하는 연구가 수행되었습니다.
*   **R, TensorFlow (온도 데이터 예측) 비교:** 무료 딥 러닝 도구인 R과 TensorFlow를 사용하여 심층 신경망을 구축하고 10년간의 한국 온도 데이터셋으로 학습시킨 결과, 은닉층이 1개 또는 2개인 경우 R이 TensorFlow보다 학습 오차(RMSE) 측면에서 전반적으로 더 우수한 성능을 보였습니다.
*   **클라우드 환경에서의 일반적인 비교:** 특정 클라우드 환경(예: OpenStack)에서 딥 러닝 프레임워크의 성능을 비교하는 연구에서는 CPU, GPU 1 Core, Multi GPU Core와 같은 다양한 컴퓨팅 환경에서 각 프레임워크의 학습 성능 지표를 추출하여 비교 분석했습니다.

##결론##
클라우드 컴퓨팅 환경에서 오픈소스 기반 딥 러닝 프레임워크들 간의 성능 비교 연구는 개발 및 운영 효율성을 극대화하는 데 중요한 의의를 가집니다. 이러한 비교 결과는 특정 애플리케이션의 요구사항(예: 정확도, 속도, 코딩 편의성, 자원 활용 효율)에 따라 가장 적합한 프레임워크를 선택하는 데 실질적인 가이드를 제공합니다. 또한, 딥 러닝 학습에 필요한 막대한 시간과 리소스의 한계를 극복하고, 클라우드 환경에서 딥 러닝 추론의 성능을 최적화하는 방안을 모색하는 데 기여합니다. 궁극적으로 이러한 연구는 산업 현장에서 딥 러닝 프레임워크 도입 성공률을 높이고, 인공지능 생태계의 지속적인 발전과 확산에 필수적인 기반 정보를 제공합니다.",0.6758

In the industrial field, PID controllers are still widely used, but there is a lack of research with deep learning to control problems. This study aims to verify whether the PID controller performance can be imitated and improved by introducing a deep learning controller into the DC motor control system. ## Main ## 1. Design of controller structure -Dep Belief Network (DBN), one of the deep neural networks, is used to implement a deep learning controller -Use the reference signal and PID output value entered into the PID controller as a learning data 2. Data collection and pretreatment -DC motor system gives a variety of control inputs to record the output torque and speed response of the PID controller. -Normalization of input and output pairs and organized for DBN learning 3. Learning and simulation -It is optimized by the BackPropagation method of the DBN to imitate PID operation characteristics. -Comparing the response between the proposal controller and the existing PID controller in the MATLAB/SIMULINK -based simulation environment 4. Comparison of performance comparisons -DBN controller is similar to PID in transitional response characteristics (overstity, up time) and normal state error. -In some experimental conditions, noise resistance and nonlinear inter -handling capacity observes superior tendency in DBN controllers. ##conclusion## Deep learning controllers effectively imitated the learned PID behavior, while showing stable control performance in nonlinear and noise environments.

But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery.

Existing collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods have shown a certain level of performance, but they have limitations such as cold start, data sparseness, and lack of long-term pattern learning. In this study, we design a matching system that combines a hybrid recommendation system and hyper-personalization technology and propose an efficient recommendation system. The core of the study is to develop a recommendation model that can improve recommendation accuracy and increase user satisfaction compared to existing systems. The proposed elements are as follows. First, the hybrid-hyper-personalization matching system provides recommendation accuracy compared to existing methods. Second, we propose an optimal product matching model that reflects user context using real-time data. Third, we optimize Personalized Recommendation System using deep learning and reinforcement learning. Fourth, we present a method to objectively evaluate recommendation performance through A/B testing., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003193557,","Title: Wave data prediction with optimized machine learning and deep learning techniques, Abstract: Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships are in the development stage and they play an important role in the upcoming future. Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Imaging of Ischemic Stroke, Abstract: Timely analysis of imaging data is critical for diagnosis and decision-making for proper treatment strategy in the cases of ischemic stroke.

A key feature is that high-performance computing device, especially CUDA-enabled GPU, supports this trend. Researchers who have difficulty accessing such systems fall behind in this fast-changing trend. In this study, we propose and implement a library called Emulearner that helps users to utilize Emulab with ease. Emulab is a research framework equipped with up to thousands of nodes developed by the University of Utah. To use Emulab nodes for deep learning requires a lot of human interactions, however. To solve this problem, Emulearner completely automates operations from authentication of Emulab log-in, node creation, configuration of deep learning to training.

This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003088774,","Title: Enhancing Smart Grid Anomaly Detection Through Deep Learning, Abstract: The modernization of power grids into smart grids introduces numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003160214",26,1.1859924140007934,row_000027,"Title: 딥 러닝을 이용한 DC 모터 제어

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002574280,","Title: Deep Learning 기반의 폐기물 선별 Vision 시스템 개발, Abstract: Recently, with the development of industry and the improvement of living standards, various wastes are generated along with the production of various products.

But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery.

The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002967457,","Title: Deep learning, Abstract: Artificial intelligence is one of the most beautiful dreams of mankind.

A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002787934,","Title: A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis, Abstract: The image analysis is an important and predominant task for classifying the different parts of the image. The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871,","Title: Affective Computing Among Individuals in Deep Learning, Abstract: This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Imaging of Ischemic Stroke, Abstract: Timely analysis of imaging data is critical for diagnosis and decision-making for proper treatment strategy in the cases of ischemic stroke.

A key feature is that high-performance computing device, especially CUDA-enabled GPU, supports this trend. Researchers who have difficulty accessing such systems fall behind in this fast-changing trend. In this study, we propose and implement a library called Emulearner that helps users to utilize Emulab with ease.

This paper researches ballet movements, which are recognized and analyzed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on deep learning. Training of the CNN is improved by particle swarm optimization (PSO). Then, 1,000 ballet videos are used as a dataset to compare optimized CNN, traditional CNN, and support vector machine (SVM) methods. The results show that the improved CNN converged fastest, stabilizing after about five iterations, whereas the traditional CNN method took approximately 20 iterations to stabilize. Additionally, after convergence, error in the improved CNN was smaller than from the traditional CNN. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM method was 84.17%, with a recognition time of 3.32 seconds; for the traditional CNN method, it was 90.16% with a recognition time of 2.68 s; and for the improved CNN method, it was 95.66% with a recognition time of only 1.35 s., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003088774,","Title: Enhancing Smart Grid Anomaly Detection Through Deep Learning, Abstract: The modernization of power grids into smart grids introduces numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003160214",27,1.1859924140007934,row_000028,"Title: 딥러닝 알고리즘에 기반한 기업부도 예측

##본론##
DBN 기반 딥 러닝을 이용한 기업부도 예측 모델은 기존 SVM 방법에 비해 여러 평가 척도에서 더 우수한 성능을 보였습니다. 특히, 시험 데이터에 대한 부도기업 예측 민감도(실제 부도기업을 부도기업으로 정확하게 예측하는 능력) 측면에서 DBN은 SVM보다 5% 이상 더 뛰어난 성능을 나타냈습니다. 이는 딥러닝이 기업부도 예측 분야에서 기존 기법 대비 높은 적용 가능성과 효과를 가짐을 시사합니다.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002574280,","Title: Deep Learning 기반의 폐기물 선별 Vision 시스템 개발, Abstract: Recently, with the development of industry and the improvement of living standards, various wastes are generated along with the production of various products.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002638568,","Title: Gamification for Education of Deep Learning, Abstract: In this study, we introduced a test platform of gamification, based on Unity-Agents, for education of deep learning.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003008557,","Title: Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms, Abstract: Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002424231,","Title: Deep Learning in Dentistry: A Literature Review, Abstract: The aim of this literature review is to investigate current application and diagnostic performance of AI in the dental field, address their limitations, and suggest possible future applications to AI in dentistry. Studies implementing deep learning in the dental field were searched, identified, and extracted from the electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus). Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8). There was a high risk of bias and applicability concerns were detected for most studies, mainly due to data selection and reference test conduct. Application of deep learning proposed in the studies exhibited wide clinical applications in the dental field. However, the evaluation criteria for the efficacy of deep learning have still not been clarified, and further verification of the reliability and applicability of the AI models is essential to implement these models to clinical practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002967457,","Title: Deep learning, Abstract: Artificial intelligence is one of the most beautiful dreams of mankind.

A time-series prediction system is still a challenging problem in machine learning and deep learning. Our main idea is to compare three methods. For this work, we analyzed an electricity demand prediction system using the current state-of-the-art deep-learning methods with a machine-learning method: error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed structure named CNN-LSTM. For this, we measured and collected electricity demand data in Germany for home appliances. We report the prediction accuracy in terms of the mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The experimental result indicates that CNN-LSTM outperforms eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002787934,","Title: A Comparison of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Deep learning for Complex Image Analysis, Abstract: The image analysis is an important and predominant task for classifying the different parts of the image. The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871,","Title: Affective Computing Among Individuals in Deep Learning, Abstract: This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning in women’s health nursing, Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning has been introduced to nursing care in recent years. The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field.

But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures.

HCI의 대표적인 기술 중 하나는 사용자 감정 인식이다. 감정의 중요성이 증대됨에 따라, 사용자의 감정을 인식하기 위해 얼굴 표정, 제스처, 음성신호, 생리신호, 안구특징 및 멀티 모달리티 (Multi-Modality) 신호를 특징으로 사용하는 방법들이 제안되고 있다. &amp;#xD; 특히, 안구 특징은 사용자가 의도적으로 제어할 수 없으며 컴퓨터가 무의식적인 특징들을 인식할 수 있기 때문에 감정인식에 적합하다. 또한 다양한 분야에 적용될 것으로 기대되는 가상현실과 증강현실을 위해 안구 특징에 기반한 감정인식 기술이 연구되어야 한다.&amp;#xD; 합성곱 신경망 (CNN)과 재귀 신경망 (RNN)과 같은 심층 학습 (Deep learning) 기술들이 다양한 분야에서 성공하고 있으며, 다양한 모달리티들을 이용하는 감정인식 연구에 적용되고 있다. 그러나 다른 모달리티들과 달리, 안구 특징만을 사용하는 심층 학습기반의 감정인식 연구는 매우 부족하다.&amp;#xD; 본 학위논문에서는 시간정보와 동공 크기와 눈 움직임 신호와 같은 안구 특징들만을 이용한 심층 학습 기반의 감정인식 방법을 제안한다.&amp;#xD; 그 과정은 다음과 같다. 먼저, 눈 깜빡임 또는 기술적인 결함으로 인해 발생되는 눈 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 데이터 미획득 구간을 채우기 위한 보간을 수행한다. 그 후 데이터의 길이와 범위를 일치시키기 위해, 신호의 시간과 각 피실험자의 신호들에 대해 정규화를 수행한다. 다음으로 동공 크기 및 눈 움직임 신호들의 시간과 주파수 정보를 분석하기 위해 Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) 특징들을 추출하고, 그 특징들을 결합하여 STFT 특징 결합 영상이라 불리우는 단일 이미지를 생성한다. 마지막으로, valence-arousal 인식을 수행하기 위해, STFT 특징 결합 영상에 적합한 심층 학습 모델을 생성한 후 leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) 방법을 이용하여 제안하는 방법의 성능을 평가한다. &amp;#xD; 대부분의 연구에서, 안구 특징은 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 성능을 향상시키기 위한 보조정보로만 사용하고 있다. 이는 안구 특징이 자극에 민감하고 수동적인 특징 추출방법으로 양질의 특징을 추출하기 어려운 많은 이상치 (Outlier)들을 포함하기 때문이다. 그러나 제안하는 방법의 분류 정확도는 Soleymani [53]가 제안한 결정 수준 융합 (DLF)와 서포트 벡터 머신 (SVM)을 이용한 방법보다 valence와 arousal 감정에 대해 각각 23.6%, 9.8% 향상된 분류 정확도를 달성하였다.&amp;#xD; 실험결과는 제안하는 방법의 효과성을 입증하였고, CNN 모델이 다른 모달리티 기반의 감정인식 방법뿐만 아니라 안구 특징 기반 감정인식에도 효과적이며, 눈 움직임 정보가 valence 감정 인식에도 효과적임을 보였다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0014668242,","Title: 딥 러닝 기반 머리 포즈 추정 및 얼굴 특징점 정렬에 관한 연구, Abstract: 컴퓨터 비전은 어떤 영상에서 장면이나 특징을 인식하는 분야로 근본적인 목적은 입체를 인식하거나 영상 내의 객체를 인식, 또는 객체 간의 관계를 이해하는 것이다. 1982년 D.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis.

The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information.

But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'. In addition learning strategies are associated with learning motivation. Students with 'meaning orientation' who struggle for deep learning, are intrinsically motivated, whereas students with 'reproduction orientation' or 'achieving orientation' are extrinsically motivated.

The accuracy of artificial intelligence depends on the amount of learning data and the appropriate algorithm. However, it is not easy to obtain learning data with a large number of entity. Less data set have large generalization errors due to overfitting. In order to minimize this generalization error, this study proposed DGA which can expect relatively high accuracy even though data with a less data set is applied to machine learning based genetic algorithm to deep learning based dropout. The idea of this paper is to determine the active state of the nodes. Using Gradient about loss function, A new fitness function is defined. Proposed Algorithm DGA is supplementing stochastic inconsistency about Dropout. Also DGA solved problem by the complexity of the fitness function and expression range of the model about Genetic Algorithm As a result of experiments using MNIST data proposed algorithm accuracy is 75.3%.

The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002638568,","Title: Gamification for Education of Deep Learning, Abstract: In this study, we introduced a test platform of gamification, based on Unity-Agents, for education of deep learning.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003008557,","Title: Diabetes detection using deep learning algorithms, Abstract: Diabetes is a metabolic disease affecting a multitude of people worldwide. Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002424231,","Title: Deep Learning in Dentistry: A Literature Review, Abstract: The aim of this literature review is to investigate current application and diagnostic performance of AI in the dental field, address their limitations, and suggest possible future applications to AI in dentistry.

Full-text articles describing the application of deep learning for the detection, classification, diagnosis, or clinical outcomes of dental problems as well as the study methods and deep learning architecture were included. The initial electronic search identified 1226 titles, and 115 studies were eventually included in the review.According to the evaluation criteria the studies all involved deep learning methods in dentistry (published 2016-2021), and the studies were divided into their scope of each subfield in dentistry; namely, anatomy (n=26), orthodontics (n=12), oral and maxillofacial surgery (n=29), endodontics and conservative dentistry (n=17), periodontology (n=5), implant dentistry (n=7), prosthodontics (n=3), forensic dentistry and identification (n=8), and etc. (n=8).

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871,","Title: Affective Computing Among Individuals in Deep Learning, Abstract: This paper is a study of deep learning among artificial intelligence technology which has been developing many technologies recently.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship.

Go 게임에 적용된 심층 학습 기술의 핵심 아이디어, CNN 레이어 구성 및 실험 비교 결과

##서론##
바둑은 복잡한 탐색 공간과 수 평가로 인해 인공지능(AI) 분야에서 오랜 도전 과제였습니다. 딥마인드(DeepMind)의 알파고(AlphaGo)가 딥러닝과 트리 탐색 알고리즘을 결합하여 높은 수준의 기량을 달성한 이후, 바둑에 심층 학습 기술을 적용하는 연구가 활발히 진행되고 있습니다. 본 보고서는 Go 게임에 적용된 심층 학습 기술의 핵심 아이디어, 제안된 CNN 레이어 구성, 그리고 주요 실험 비교 결과를 간결하게 정리합니다.

##본론##
###1. 심층 학습 기술의 핵심 아이디어###
Go 게임에 적용된 심층 학습 기술의 핵심 아이디어는 바둑의 복잡한 상태와 형세 판단 사이의 상관관계를 찾아 최적의 수를 예측하고 의사 결정을 내리는 데 있습니다. 이는 주로 다음과 같은 접근 방식을 통해 구현됩니다:
*   **패턴 매칭 및 다음 수 예측:** 딥러닝을 활용하여 바둑판의 패턴을 인식하고 다음 수를 예측하는 순수한 패턴 매칭 접근 방식이 사용됩니다.
*   **심층 강화 학습(DRL)의 활용:** 딥러닝의 인지 능력과 강화 학습의 의사 결정 능력을 결합하여 환경과의 상호작용을 통해 최적의 정책을 학습하고 장기적인 누적 보상을 최대화합니다.
*   **프로 기보 학습:** 실제 프로 기사들의 대국 기록(기보)을 CNN으로 학습시켜 복잡한 바둑 상황에서의 형세 판단 능력을 모방하고 발전시킵니다.
*   **효율적인 특징 학습:** 신경망 구조를 수정하여 네트워크 학습 효율성을 높이고, 특징을 효과적으로 학습하며 은닉층 특징의 표현 능력을 강화하는 데 중점을 둡니다.

###2. 제안된 CNN 레이어 구성###
Go 게임에 적용된 CNN 레이어 구성은 연구마다 다양한 형태로 제안되었습니다:
*   **다층 은닉 레이어:** 한 연구에서는 3개의 CNN 레이어를 포함하는 5개의 숨겨진 레이어를 사용하여 데이터를 학습하는 방법을 제시했습니다.
*   **모듈 기반 확장:** 알파고의 특징 추출 방법을 확장하여 GoogLeNet의 Inception 모듈과 Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM)을 기반으로 하는 효과적인 신경망 모듈이 제안되었습니다. 이 모듈들은 복잡한 바둑 상황에서 학습을 안내하는 역할을 합니다.
*   **경량화 모델:** 위에서 언급된 두 모델은 앙상블 학습으로 결합되어 일반화 성능을 향상시키면서도 모델 파라미터 수를 십만 단위로 크게 줄여 효율성을 높였습니다.
*   **Maximum-Average-Out (MAO) 유닛 구조:** 조각별 함수 사고(piecewise function thinking) 기반의 MAO 유닛 구조를 가진 합성곱 신경망이 제안되어 특징 학습의 효율성과 은닉층 특징의 표현 능력을 향상시키는 데 기여했습니다.

###3. 실험 비교 결과###
Go 게임에 적용된 심층 학습 기술의 실험 비교 결과는 다음과 같습니다:
*   **다음 수 예측 정확도:** 제안된 심층 학습 모델들은 두 가지 바둑 데이터셋에서 각각 46.9%와 50.8%의 다음 수 예측 정확도를 달성하여 기존 모델들보다 상당한 성능 향상을 보였습니다.
*   **대국 승률:** 지도학습 기반 CNN 가치평가 네트워크는 선행 연구의 ANN 가치평가 네트워크와의 대국에서 흑일 때 69.7%, 백일 때 72.1%의 승률을 기록했습니다. 강화학습을 적용하여 발전시킨 네트워크는 ANN을 상대로 흑일 때 100%, CNN을 상대로 76%의 승률을, 백일 때 ANN을 상대로 100%, CNN을 상대로 78%의 승률을 보이며 성능 개선을 입증했습니다.
*   **MAO 유닛의 우수성:** MAO 유닛 구조를 가진 합성곱 신경망은 AlphaGo Zero 프레임워크에 적용되어 ResNet18 네트워크와 비교했을 때 10게임 중 8승을 거두며 우수한 성능을 보였습니다. 이는 적은 컴퓨팅 파워로도 효율적인 게임 알고리즘 개발이 가능함을 시사합니다.
*   **형세 판단 정확도:** 바둑의 최종 형세 판단을 위한 학습 시스템(GONE)은 9x9 게임 기록에서 생사 여부를 98.9%의 정확도로 분류했으며, 게임 후반부에는 99%까지 정확도가 상승했습니다.
*   **프로그램 간 비교:** HuuDucGo, Orego, Fuego와 같은 바둑 프로그램들을 비교한 결과, 제안된 딥러닝 기반 프로그램이 다른 프로그램들과 유사하거나 수용 가능한 다음 수 제안 수렴도를 보였습니다.

##결론##
Go 게임에 적용된 심층 학습 기술은 복잡한 바둑의 특성을 이해하고 다음 수를 예측하며 형세를 판단하는 데 혁신적인 발전을 가져왔습니다. 다양한 CNN 레이어 구성과 딥러닝-강화학습 결합을 통해 모델의 효율성과 정확도를 높였으며, 실제 대국 및 예측 실험에서 기존 모델 대비 월등히 향상된 성능을 입증했습니다. 이러한 연구 결과는 바둑 AI의 발전을 넘어 일반적인 복잡한 의사 결정 문제 해결에도 중요한 시사점을 제공합니다.",0.6758

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다. IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다. IT 컨버전스 및 기술표준화의 이해, n-Screen 콘텐츠와 서비스를 향한 GㆍBㆍC의 역할변화와 정보 활용의 다양화 등등 새로운 시각에서 접근해야 한다.&nbsp;여기서 소개하는 Original XML은 쌍방향ㆍ다방향 소통과 표현을 통해 21세기를 주도할 Community Culture Society를 실현할 것으로 기대된다.

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes.

The effects of IT convergence-contents were analyzed on the occupational performance of the elderly. This investigation was done with 100 elderly people above 65 years of age who lived in local community and two senior welfare centers in Busan and Kyeongbuk. The 100 elderly people were split into two groups of 50: the one group who has experience with IT convergence-contents was the experiment group, and the other group with no experience was the control group. In both groups, body functions, cognitive functions, activities of daily living and community participation were tested. The experimental group had higher scores for cognitive function, and activities of daily living than that of the control group. In conclusion, future studies can support continued IT convergence-contents at the local business community level rather than with smaller samples.

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201528764978526,","Title: Investigations on IT/ET and IT/BT Convergence Technology Using Power Line Communications, Abstract: Due to enhanced high IT (information technology) development, IT-based technology convergences such as IT/ET(electric technology), IT/BT(biology technology) and IT/NT(nano technology) are actively merging trend and their applications spread wide.

Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities.

Can you provide a brief synthesis of the performance evaluation criteria and standardization framework proposed for u-IT convergence devices?,"##Assessment and Standardization of Performance Criteria for u-IT Convergence Devices## ##Introduction## The rapid evolution of ubiquitous IT technologies has driven the development of convergence devices across communication, broadcasting, portals, content, equipment, and solution domains. To support reliable deployment and market adoption, a structured framework for assessing device performance and ensuring interoperability is essential. ##Main Body## The study first defines u-IT convergence devices and identifies common sensing elements—temperature, pressure, magnetic, optical, gas, and humidity sensors—that underpin their functionality. It then establishes three core evaluation dimensions: technical feasibility (performance and accuracy), economic feasibility (cost and resource efficiency), and management feasibility (maintainability and operational support). Building on these criteria, the research proposes a standardization framework for network-integrated devices, detailing guidelines for certification, interoperability testing, and quality assurance. ##Conclusion## By integrating rigorous performance metrics with a unified standardization approach, this framework fosters consistent certification, enhances device safety and reliability, and lays the groundwork for broader adoption of u-IT convergence systems in a ubiquitous information society.",없음,없음,"Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다. IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다.

However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes.

The effects of IT convergence-contents were analyzed on the occupational performance of the elderly. This investigation was done with 100 elderly people above 65 years of age who lived in local community and two senior welfare centers in Busan and Kyeongbuk. The 100 elderly people were split into two groups of 50: the one group who has experience with IT convergence-contents was the experiment group, and the other group with no experience was the control group. In both groups, body functions, cognitive functions, activities of daily living and community participation were tested. The experimental group had higher scores for cognitive function, and activities of daily living than that of the control group. In conclusion, future studies can support continued IT convergence-contents at the local business community level rather than with smaller samples.

##Introduction##
The rapid advancement of u-IT technology has led to the development of u-IT convergence devices across various sectors, including communication, broadcasting, portals, content, equipment, and solutions. To ensure the stability, reliability, and value of these devices in a ubiquitous information society, a comprehensive framework for performance evaluation and standardization is essential. This synthesis outlines the proposed criteria for evaluating the performance of u-IT convergence devices and the associated standardization framework.

##Main Body##
**Performance Evaluation Criteria:**
The proposed performance evaluation criteria for u-IT convergence devices are multifaceted, encompassing technical, economic, and managerial aspects. Specifically, for devices that integrate sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure, magnetism, light, gas, humidity sensors), their definition and evaluation are based on these three core criteria (NPAP12915394).

More detailed and specific evaluation criteria are also identified for various types of u-IT convergence devices:
*   **Sensor and Module Performance:** For u-IT power convergence devices, module-specific performance evaluation includes assessing temperature, humidity, and fire sensors, with a strong emphasis on safety and security (NPAP09908083, JAKO201030159715768). Electrical IT devices for U-City safety are evaluated based on their ability to detect insulation resistance, leakage current, high temperature, smoke, CO2, flame, and fire, as well as their electrical safety protection technology and remote management capabilities (NPAP10059515).
*   **Integrated Performance Models:** An integrated performance evaluation model for public u-IT services is proposed, defined by three indices: evaluation index for each evaluation stage, performance viewpoint, and performance type (ART001624002, JAKO201113036232823).
*   **Technology and Product Management:** A U-IT Technology Evaluation and Product Selection Management Processing (TE & PSMP) design model is suggested for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to comprehensively evaluate their technology environment and related capabilities, and to quantitatively analyze and assess technology (NPAP08519245, JAKO200835054206980).
*   **Security and Service Quality:** For intrusion prevention systems, a convergence performance evaluation model is built upon Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408) and ISO international standards for software product evaluation, focusing on security audit, user data protection, security certification, detection time, throughput, and attack blocking performance (JAKO201518564243648). In the context of cloud services, performance evaluation for virtual machines (VMs) includes system performance, network performance, service performance, availability, and security performance (DIKO0014041997).

**Standardization Framework:**
The standardization framework for u-IT convergence devices is closely linked to their performance evaluation and aims to ensure interoperability, safety, and market competitiveness.
*   **Criteria-Based Standardization:** Standardization criteria for u-IT convergence network devices are developed in accordance with their established performance evaluation criteria (NPAP12915394).
*   **National and International Standards:** For power-related u-IT convergence devices, products that pass conformity assessments are certified under national standards like KS and electrical safety product certifications (JAKO200909659870837). Furthermore, research is conducted to establish domestic technical standards for low-power u-IT devices, taking into account international trends and output limits (JAKO201120859385966). International standards such as Common Criteria (ISO/IEC 15408) and ISO standards for software product evaluation are explicitly used for certain IT convergence products, like intrusion prevention systems (JAKO201518564243648).
*   **Interoperability and Regulatory Support:** Standardization efforts involve various performance and technical standard bodies, international standardization organizations, and related standard-developing organizations to ensure the interoperability of these technologies, particularly in specialized industries such as shipbuilding and marine (JAKO202056463863290). Beyond technical standards, an effective standardization framework also necessitates addressing broader standardization issues, establishing robust legal and institutional regulations, and providing consistent policy support (JAKO201434441684271).

##Conclusion##
In summary, the performance evaluation criteria for u-IT convergence devices are comprehensive, covering technical, economic, and managerial aspects, with specific metrics tailored to different device types, including sensors, power devices, and software systems. The standardization framework builds upon these evaluation criteria, incorporating national and international standards, and emphasizing the importance of interoperability, regulatory clarity, and policy support to foster the development and widespread adoption of reliable u-IT convergence technologies.",0.6758

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence.

Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities.

### Introduction###
An IT/OT-based Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) represents a significant evolution in power distribution systems, moving beyond traditional SCADA and distribution automation systems. This advancement is driven by the blurring technical boundaries between Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology (OT), aiming to enhance distribution system operation performance through comprehensive integration. The core idea is to leverage the strengths of both IT and OT domains to create a more efficient, intelligent, and resilient power grid.

### Main Body###
The key design elements and convergence concepts of an IT/OT-based ADMS can be distilled as follows:

**Key Design Elements:**

1.  **Integrated IT and OT Employment:** The fundamental design principle is the co-employment of IT and OT within the ADMS. This means that the system is not merely an overlay but a deeply integrated architecture where both technologies work in concert.
2.  **Global Information and Function Integration:** An ADMS is designed to increase distribution system operation efficiency by incorporating global information and functions from various other systems. This involves collecting data from diverse sources and making it accessible and actionable across the entire distribution network.
3.  **Interoperability:** A crucial design element is ensuring high levels of interoperability between different systems and components. This concept is vital for blurring the technical boundaries between IT and OT, allowing for seamless data exchange and coordinated operations.
4.  **Hybrid Analytics Platform:** The system should incorporate a sophisticated analytics platform that balances edge and cloud computing. High-speed analytics at the edge are used for real-time regulatory control and safety system diagnostics, while data lake analysis in the cloud supports strategic functions like planning, supply chain management, and business optimization.
5.  **Robust Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Connectivity:** Effective ADMS design relies on clever and sufficient IIoT connectivity to enable the integration of operational data from various field devices and sensors into the IT domain for analysis and decision-making.
6.  **Intermediary Solutions for Integration:** To overcome conflicting requirements and problematic interfaces between IT and OT, design elements like an Industrial Business Process Twin (IBPT) can be employed. An IBPT acts as an intermediary, effectively reducing the number of direct IT/OT interfaces and streamlining communication channels during the design phase.
7.  **Standardized Communication Protocols:** The use of standardized protocols, such as OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN), is essential for enabling effective and reliable communication and collaboration between IT and OT components, especially in the context of the Industrial Internet.
8.  **Balanced Security Framework:** Given the distinct security priorities of IT (Privacy, Authentication, Integrity, Non-repudiation - PAIN) and OT (Availability, Integrity, Confidentiality - AIC), the ADMS design must incorporate a balanced security framework that addresses and reconciles these potentially conflicting requirements.
9.  **Organizational and Governance Structure:** Successful implementation requires a design that includes close cooperation between IT and OT teams, potentially through an ""IT/OT tandem"" (e.g., a CIO and a central OT responsible person). Top management support and a step-by-step implementation approach are also critical for successful convergence.

**Convergence Concepts:**

1.  **Blurring Technical Boundaries:** The fundamental concept is the dissolution of the traditional, isolated technical boundaries between IT and OT. This is driven by advancements in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and power system technology, leading to new paradigms like interoperability.
2.  **Enhanced Operational Efficiency and Performance:** The overarching goal of IT/OT convergence in ADMS is to significantly improve the operational efficiency and performance of power distribution systems. This includes better monitoring, control, and automation capabilities.
3.  **Holistic Data Utilization and Actionable Insights:** Convergence enables the collection and aggregation of data from diverse operational sources, which is then subjected to analytics to generate actionable insights. These insights positively impact critical areas such as safety, environmental performance, operational effectiveness, and profitability.
4.  **Strategic Alignment:** The convergence emphasizes the strategic alignment of IT and OT objectives with broader business goals. This ensures that technology investments contribute directly to value creation, risk management, and optimal resource utilization.
5.  **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Integration:** The ADMS embodies the concept of integrating advanced ICT within Cyber-Physical Systems, leading to ""smart"" distribution networks. This integration is a cornerstone for realizing the visions of Industry 4.0 and the nascent Industry 5.0, which aim for sustainable and circular value chains.
6.  **Collaborative Expertise:** The convergence recognizes that optimal outcomes are achieved through a collaborative environment where both IT and OT domain expertise, combined with operational industry knowledge, are brought together within the same teams. This fosters a shared understanding and integrated problem-solving approach.

### Conclusion###
An IT/OT-based Advanced Distribution Management System is characterized by its integrated design, which merges the distinct functionalities and priorities of Information Technology and Operational Technology. Key design elements include a unified architecture for IT and OT, global information sharing, robust interoperability, hybrid edge-cloud analytics, IIoT connectivity, and specialized intermediary solutions. The underlying convergence concepts revolve around blurring traditional technical boundaries, achieving enhanced operational efficiency, leveraging holistic data for actionable insights, ensuring strategic alignment, and fostering a collaborative environment for cyber-physical integration. These elements and concepts collectively enable a more intelligent, responsive, and secure management of modern distribution networks.",0.6758
Could you outline the principal concerns IT companies face in defense-related IT convergence and the proposed solutions for cost estimation and governance?,"##Key Challenges and Solutions in Defense IT Convergence## ##Introduction## Defense-related IT convergence involves integrating commercial information technologies into military acquisition and operations. While this integration promises enhanced capability and efficiency, IT firms encounter unique hurdles when entering defense projects due to stringent requirements and complex procurement structures. ##Main Body## 1. Role Clarification: IT companies often face ambiguity over their responsibilities in defense programs, stemming from traditional procurement models that favor established defense contractors. Clear definition of tasks, deliverables, and accountability is proposed via standardized role descriptions and contractual frameworks tailored to IT services. 2. Governance and Control Tower: The absence of a centralized oversight entity leads to fragmented decision-making and delayed approvals. Establishing a dedicated defense IT convergence “control tower” can unify stakeholders, streamline processes, and monitor progress through joint military–industry governance boards. 3. Software Cost Estimation: Conventional cost models are ill-suited for software-intensive projects, resulting in budget overruns and disputes. Adopting recognized estimation methodologies—such as COCOMO II or function-point analysis—alongside modular development contracts can yield more realistic forecasts and cost transparency. ##Conclusion## Addressing these concerns through explicit role definitions, a centralized governance structure, and robust software cost-estimation practices enables smoother collaboration between IT firms and defense organizations, ultimately reducing risk and improving project outcomes.",없음,없음,"Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201266833852356,","Title: Convergence IT 관련 기사, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART54596509,","Title: IT convergence and security, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART67385534,","Title: PHOTONICS IT CONVERGENCE - IT Korea, Shanghai EXPO, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201045340584669,","Title: IT/OT Convergence 기반의 Advanced Distribution Management System의 설계, Abstract: Power automation system to operate power distribution systems can be distinguished by distribution SCADA with remote monitoring and control; and distribution automation system with basic functions such as service restoration to the distribution SCADA; and distribution management system which is operated by various applications in order to enhance distribution system operation performance based on the distribution automation system.

##Introduction##
Defense-related IT convergence is crucial for advancing weapon systems and enhancing military operations. However, IT companies engaging in this sector face significant challenges, particularly concerning the clarity of their roles, accurate cost estimation, and robust governance structures. This document outlines these principal concerns and presents proposed solutions for both cost estimation and governance, drawing insights from various studies.

##Main Body##
###Principal Concerns for IT Companies in Defense-Related IT Convergence###
IT companies encounter several key issues when participating in defense-related IT convergence efforts:

1.  **Unclear Role Definition:** A primary concern is the lack of clarity regarding the specific roles and responsibilities of IT firms within defense IT-convergent projects and the overall defense acquisition process (JAKO201415642602449).
2.  **Software Development Cost Estimation:** Accurately and reasonably estimating software development costs in the defense acquisition process is a major challenge (JAKO201415642602449).
3.  **Integration and Deployment Issues:** Difficulties arise in introducing rapidly changing IT to military areas, establishing swift deployment procedures for verified commercial technologies, and navigating regulations for promoting domestic software (JAKO201207364424562).
4.  **Cybersecurity Risks:** The increasing digital transformation and IT/OT (Operational Technology) convergence lead to a growing exposure to cyberthreats. Existing IT security measures alone are often insufficient, and there are significant technical, human, and system gaps between IT and OT domains (NART117320297, NPAP13520254).
5.  **Lack of Collaboration and Conflicting Requirements:** Insufficient collaboration between IT and OT teams hinders cybersecurity efforts (NART117320297). Furthermore, IT and OT networks often have conflicting requirements, such as balancing availability (OT) with confidentiality (IT) (NPAP12925376).
6.  **Governance Deficiencies:** The absence of a clear ""control tower"" for defense IT convergence and a lack of systematic research on defense IT governance contribute to governance risk factors in experimental programs (JAKO201415642602449, NART69876191, ATN0037467542). There's also a concern about the lack of consistent security considerations from design to operation, particularly in network boundary areas (JAKO202032860595382).

###Proposed Solutions for Cost Estimation###
To address the challenges in cost estimation for defense-related IT convergence, the following solutions are proposed:

1.  **Reasonable Software Development Cost Estimation:** Implement methods to ensure fair and accurate estimation of software development costs within the defense acquisition framework (JAKO201415642602449).
2.  **Improved IT Operation Service Cost Models:** Develop new cost models and optimization methods for IT operation services. This includes improving service request management processes through adequate reception and control, proper valuation, utilizing project management methodologies, and effective organization and time management of service personnel (JAKO200706942464811).
3.  **Specialized Software Cost Estimation Techniques:** Employ specific cost estimation techniques for embedded software in weapon systems, such as the PRICE S model. This involves estimating software scale using metrics like code lines and function points, and validating these estimates against actual project costs (JAKO200604623513236).
4.  **Architecture-Aware Cost Estimation:** Integrate software architecture cost estimation techniques, like applying COCOMO II, to systematically account for the impact of architectural design on development costs. This approach complements traditional quality assessments by considering both quality and cost during architecture selection (JAKO201015939079004).
5.  **Reliability-Corrected Cost Models:** Enhance existing cost models, such as TRANSCOST (which typically uses performance and mass), by incorporating reliability concepts. This allows for more precise cost estimations for complex systems like launch vehicles based on desired reliability levels (JAKO201213549741443).
6.  **Machine Learning for Demand Forecasting:** Leverage machine learning and deep learning models (e.g., XG-Boost) to improve the accuracy of demand forecasting for spare parts, especially for items with low volume and irregular demand patterns. This leads to better resource management and cost efficiency (ATN0052776138).
7.  **NDF (No Defect Found) Cost Estimation Methodology:** Implement methodologies like the PAF model (quality cost analysis) and Activity Based Costing (ABC) to accurately estimate costs associated with ""No Defect Found"" phenomena in complex, converged products. This aids in quality management and overall cost reduction (JAKO202120941755303).

###Proposed Solutions for Governance###
Effective governance is critical for successful defense IT convergence. Proposed solutions include:

1.  **Establish a Central Control Tower:** Create a dedicated ""control tower"" for defense IT convergence to provide unified direction, oversight, and coordination across all stakeholders (JAKO201415642602449).
2.  **Clarify Roles and Responsibilities:** Clearly define the roles and responsibilities of IT firms and other entities involved in defense IT convergence efforts (JAKO201415642602449).
3.  **Develop Comprehensive Frameworks and Processes:** Establish robust frameworks and processes for applying IT to the defense sector, including various business models, ensuring alignment with national IT convergence policies (JAKO201207364424562).
4.  **Implement Defense IT Governance Frameworks:** Develop and implement core strategies for building strong defense IT governance frameworks to achieve defense visions and goals. This involves defining governance principles, designing effective decision-making systems, and establishing clear operational guidelines (DIKO0012543052, JAKO201029335104637, NART69876191).
5.  **Adopt IT/OT Governance Frameworks:** Utilize specific IT/OT Governance Frameworks for successful convergence. Key recommendations include ensuring top management support, using security as a primary driver, appointing a central OT responsible person, fostering physical proximity and collaboration between IT and OT teams, continuously demonstrating the added value of convergence, and adopting a step-by-step implementation approach (NART135127671).
6.  **Enhance Security Governance:** Develop security governance frameworks that integrate strategic, managerial/operational, and technical perspectives, while also considering human factors, to effectively address complex security threats in converged environments. This includes establishing single security standards, enabling direct top management involvement, and promoting self-responsible security activities (JAKO201526650061635).
7.  **Utilize Extended Risk Assessment:** Implement extended risk assessment forms for Industrial Automation and Control Systems (IACS) security, which comprehensively cover both IT and OT aspects, as well as safety, security, cyber, and physical considerations (NPAP13520254).
8.  **Implement Data Governance Models:** Adopt data governance models to ensure business and IT alignment, thereby enhancing competitive strength and ensuring high-quality data management across defense systems (JAKO201322836625444).
9.  **Develop Multi-Metadata Repository Management System (MRMM):** Implement MRMM technology to support systematic standard management of defense data, which improves data sharing and interoperability for smart defense initiatives (JAKO202012758285347).
10. **Big Data Governance for Cyberspace Operations:** Propose and implement big data governance models specifically designed to support effective military operations in cyberspace. This involves classifying missions and data types and integrating them into a robust governance framework (ATN0025420792).
11. **AI Service Governance:** For the integration of AI services in public policy and defense, establish clear development guidelines, a governance toolkit for design, development, and deployment, and explicit principles for operation, covering planning, lifecycle management, model building and verification, deployment and monitoring, and accountability (JAKO202412343246540).
12. **Reinforce Network Boundary Management:** Establish responsible organizations and reinforce their roles in managing network boundary areas. This includes studying and implementing relevant standards and guidelines to mitigate security concerns arising from increased control network connectivity (JAKO202032860595382).
13. **Public Sector IT Governance Strategies:** For public sector IT governance, key strategies include the selective application of IT governance frameworks, phased implementation, establishing visible performance evaluation systems, providing training for organizational members, and ensuring proactive participation from top decision-makers (DIKO0011751537).

##Conclusion##
IT companies face multifaceted challenges in defense-related IT convergence, ranging from defining their roles and accurately estimating costs to managing complex cybersecurity threats and establishing effective governance. The proposed solutions emphasize the need for clear organizational structures, advanced cost modeling techniques, robust security frameworks, and comprehensive governance models that promote collaboration, transparency, and strategic alignment between IT and defense objectives.

How can you succinctly capture the factors that shape consumer purchase attitudes toward IT-based convergence products and their implications for competitiveness?,"##Title## Factors Influencing Consumer Attitudes toward IT‐Based Convergence Products and Their Competitive Implications ##Introduction## This study examines how consumers’ perceived attitudes toward IT‐based convergence products shape their purchase decisions and explores the strategic implications for firms seeking to strengthen competitiveness in this emerging market. ##Main Body## Grounded in established decision‐making theories, the research formulates and empirically tests hypotheses about key attitude drivers. Perceived usefulness stands out as the dominant factor: when consumers believe that a convergence product offers clear functional benefits and enhances their tasks, they are far more likely to adopt it. Other elements—such as ease of use, technological novelty, and alignment with lifestyle needs—also contribute but to a lesser extent. By measuring these perceptions through surveys and statistical analyses, the study identifies which product attributes most influence consumer attitudes. Armed with these insights, companies can prioritize feature development, tailor communication strategies, and refine pricing models to highlight utility and differentiate offerings. ##Conclusion## Focusing on the utility dimension of convergence products enables firms to cultivate favorable consumer attitudes, paving the way for successful market entry and sustained competitive advantage.",없음,없음,"Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes.

###Introduction###
Consumer purchase attitudes toward IT-based convergence products are influenced by a multifaceted array of factors, ranging from the inherent characteristics of the products themselves to individual consumer traits and external market conditions. Understanding these factors is crucial for businesses to develop effective strategies and enhance their competitiveness in the rapidly evolving IT convergence market.

###Main Body###
The factors that shape consumer purchase attitudes toward IT-based convergence products can be succinctly captured as follows:

1.  **Product-Centric Attributes:**
    *   **Perceived Utility and Convenience:** Consumers are significantly influenced by the perceived usefulness (효용성) and ease of use (지각된 편리성) of IT convergence products. This includes mobile functionality and the ability to merge digital content (Doc 3, 4, 6).
    *   **Value Proposition:** Functional, epistemic (knowledge-related), and emotional values are critical. Products that offer hedonic value (emotional appeal) are particularly influential for innovative consumers (Doc 5).
    *   **Inter-Product Relationship:** The perceived consistency and relative advantage derived from the relationship between the constituent products within a convergence offering are major determinants of consumer attitude and purchase intention (Doc 6). Factors like complementarity and substitutability also play a role (Doc 8).
    *   **Performance Expectancy:** The anticipated performance of the convergence technology influences acceptance (Doc 22).

2.  **Consumer-Specific Characteristics:**
    *   **Innovativeness:** Consumer innovativeness (innate, domain-specific, actualized) significantly impacts purchase intentions, especially by moderating the effect of emotional value (Doc 5, 22). Motivated consumer innovativeness, categorized into functional, hedonic, rational, and reliable aspects, also affects satisfaction and purchase intention (Doc 34).
    *   **Technological Propensity:** A consumer's general inclination towards technology (technographics) influences their attitudes and purchase intentions (Doc 6).
    *   **Cognitive Processing:** Interpretation strategies (relational vs. attribute interpretation) and consumer goals (main category vs. modifying category related goals) differentially affect beliefs and attitudes towards convergence products (Doc 19).
    *   **Personal and Environmental Factors:** Broader personal and environmental factors can influence perceived usefulness, ease of use, and business-technology fit (Doc 4).

3.  **Perceived Risks and Expectations:**
    *   **Functional, Emotional, and Psychological Risks:** Consumers evaluate convergence products based on perceived functional and emotional risks (Doc 6), as well as psychological risks (Doc 8).
    *   **Security Risk:** Perceived security risk is a factor in consumer adoption of new technologies (Doc 22).
    *   **Expectations:** Consumers' expectations regarding benefits, risks, and situational relevance influence their satisfaction with digital convergence products (Doc 14).

4.  **Market and Service Experience:**
    *   **Shopping Experience and Customer Service:** Positive shopping experiences and effective customer service contribute to favorable attitudes and purchase intentions (Doc 24).
    *   **Business-Technology Fit:** The alignment between the product's technology and business needs influences acceptance (Doc 4).

**Implications for Competitiveness:**

Understanding these factors provides critical insights for businesses to enhance their competitiveness:

*   **Strategic Market Entry and Growth:** By identifying and leveraging the utility that IT convergence products offer, companies can strengthen their competitiveness and ensure successful market entry (Doc 1).
*   **Targeted Product Development:** Focusing on specific value creation factors (e.g., mobile functionality, digital content merging) and addressing service process limitations (simultaneousity, perishability) can lead to a relative advantage (Doc 3).
*   **Effective Marketing and Segmentation:** Marketers should emphasize functional, epistemic, and emotional values, particularly for innovative consumer segments. Consumer innovativeness can be a valuable variable for segmenting the market (Doc 5).
*   **Risk Mitigation and Trust Building:** Addressing perceived functional, emotional, psychological, and security risks is essential to foster positive consumer attitudes and trust, which are vital for adoption (Doc 6, 8, 22).
*   **Optimized Customer Experience:** Designing IT convergence systems with a focus on perceived usefulness, ease of use, and a strong business-technology fit can invigorate service adoption (Doc 4). For AI-based shopping assistants, this means including features for comparing information, robust search functions, and payment compatibility (Doc 34).
*   **Continuous Evaluation and Adaptation:** Companies must continuously reflect consumer evaluations in their product development to avoid failures and ensure market success (Doc 8).

###Conclusion###
In essence, consumer purchase attitudes toward IT-based convergence products are shaped by a dynamic interplay of perceived product values (utility, convenience, functional, emotional, epistemic), the nature of the integrated components, individual consumer characteristics (innovativeness, technological affinity, cognitive styles), and perceived risks and expectations. For businesses, competitiveness hinges on a deep understanding of these factors to inform strategic product design, targeted marketing, effective risk management, and the creation of seamless customer experiences, ultimately leading to successful market adoption and sustained growth.",0.6758

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다. IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다. IT 컨버전스 및 기술표준화의 이해, n-Screen 콘텐츠와 서비스를 향한 GㆍBㆍC의 역할변화와 정보 활용의 다양화 등등 새로운 시각에서 접근해야 한다.&nbsp;여기서 소개하는 Original XML은 쌍방향ㆍ다방향 소통과 표현을 통해 21세기를 주도할 Community Culture Society를 실현할 것으로 기대된다.

However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes.

The effects of IT convergence-contents were analyzed on the occupational performance of the elderly. This investigation was done with 100 elderly people above 65 years of age who lived in local community and two senior welfare centers in Busan and Kyeongbuk. The 100 elderly people were split into two groups of 50: the one group who has experience with IT convergence-contents was the experiment group, and the other group with no experience was the control group. In both groups, body functions, cognitive functions, activities of daily living and community participation were tested. The experimental group had higher scores for cognitive function, and activities of daily living than that of the control group. In conclusion, future studies can support continued IT convergence-contents at the local business community level rather than with smaller samples.

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201528764978526,","Title: Investigations on IT/ET and IT/BT Convergence Technology Using Power Line Communications, Abstract: Due to enhanced high IT (information technology) development, IT-based technology convergences such as IT/ET(electric technology), IT/BT(biology technology) and IT/NT(nano technology) are actively merging trend and their applications spread wide.

Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities. This innovation guarantees intuitive monitoring of vaccination progress and curtailment of COVID-19 spread through compliance enforcement., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13570757,","Title: Convergence of Energy and IT Sectors, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART133388413",35,1.1859924140007934,row_000036,"Title: 한국 IT융합 신산업 역량강화요인

1.  **정책 및 제도 개선**: IT융합에 대한 인식을 확산하고 관련 제도를 개선하는 것이 중요합니다. 이는 정부의 선제적인 지원 정책과 기업의 투자를 통해 이루어지며, 특히 국가정보화와 산업융합 발전 기본 계획을 통한 지원이 강조됩니다.
2.  **다양한 IT기술과 산업협력 모델 발굴**: IT 자체의 고도화를 바탕으로 다른 분야의 기술 개발과 산업 발전을 견인하고 새로운 산업을 창출해야 합니다. 이는 자동차, 조선, 건설, 의료, 섬유 등 전통 산업과의 접목을 포함하며, 클라우드, 3D 융합, 사물인터넷, 헬스케어, 금융, 인공지능, 인체 플랫폼 및 보안 분야에서의 선제적인 기술, 제품, 서비스 개발이 요구됩니다.
3.  **신 시장 창출을 통한 IT융합 확산**: IT융합을 통해 새로운 시장을 개척하고 확산하는 전략이 필요합니다. 세계 IT융합 시장 규모가 2020년 3.6조 달러로 고성장이 전망되는 만큼, 국내 시장에서도 신 시장 창출이 중요합니다.
4.  **창의적 IT융합 인재 양성**: IT융합 시대를 이끌어갈 창의적인 인재를 양성하는 것이 핵심 역량 강화 요인으로 꼽힙니다.
5.  **중소기업 IT 융합 역량 강화**: 중소기업의 융합 활성화를 위해서는 융합을 통한 R&D 역량 강화, 융합 성과의 보호 및 활용도 제고, 그리고 융합 인프라 확충이 우선적으로 추진될 필요가 있습니다.

이러한 역량강화요인을 도출하기 위한 연구 결과는 주로 다음과 같은 방법론을 통해 이루어졌습니다.

*   **전문가 델파이 조사 및 설문 분석**: 2011년도에 실시된 정책연구에서는 학계 및 공공기관 전문가를 대상으로 델파이 조사를 진행하여 한국의 IT 융합 역량 수준 변화를 평가하고 역량강화요인을 도출했습니다. 또한, IT 융합과 관련된 주요국의 산업 전략 및 기술개발 동향을 파악하고 전문가 설문조사 결과를 바탕으로 한국의 IT 융합역량 수준을 평가하여 육성 및 선도 방안을 제언하기도 했습니다.
*   **Porter의 다이아몬드 모형 적용**: 국내 IT 산업의 경쟁력을 체계적으로 분석하기 위해 Porter의 다이아몬드 모형(요소조건, 수요조건, 전략·구조·경쟁, 관련·지원분야)을 적용하고 국내 IT 부문 전문가들을 대상으로 설문조사를 수행하여 정책 방향과 전략적 시사점을 제시했습니다.
*   **특허 데이터 분석**: 기업의 기술융합 성과 수준을 체계적으로 파악하고 경영성과와의 관계를 분석하기 위해 특허 IPC 코드 정보를 활용하여 기술융합 다양성을 분석했습니다. 이를 통해 기술융합 성과 수준이 매출액 증가율과 정(+)의 관계에 있음을 실증 분석했습니다.

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201266833852356,","Title: Convergence IT 관련 기사, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART54596509,","Title: IT convergence and security, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART67385534,","Title: PHOTONICS IT CONVERGENCE - IT Korea, Shanghai EXPO, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201045340584669,","Title: IT/OT Convergence 기반의 Advanced Distribution Management System의 설계, Abstract: Power automation system to operate power distribution systems can be distinguished by distribution SCADA with remote monitoring and control; and distribution automation system with basic functions such as service restoration to the distribution SCADA; and distribution management system which is operated by various applications in order to enhance distribution system operation performance based on the distribution automation system.

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다.

A key technological convergence is the fusion of biotechnology (BT) and information technology (IT). Major IT advances have led to innovative devices that allow us to advance BT. However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes.

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다. IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다. IT 컨버전스 및 기술표준화의 이해, n-Screen 콘텐츠와 서비스를 향한 GㆍBㆍC의 역할변화와 정보 활용의 다양화 등등 새로운 시각에서 접근해야 한다.&nbsp;여기서 소개하는 Original XML은 쌍방향ㆍ다방향 소통과 표현을 통해 21세기를 주도할 Community Culture Society를 실현할 것으로 기대된다.

However, the lack of data on IT-BT convergence is a major impediment: relatively little research has analyzed the inter-disciplinary relationship of different industries. We propose a systematic approach to analyzing the technological convergence of BT and IT. Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes.

The effects of IT convergence-contents were analyzed on the occupational performance of the elderly. This investigation was done with 100 elderly people above 65 years of age who lived in local community and two senior welfare centers in Busan and Kyeongbuk. The 100 elderly people were split into two groups of 50: the one group who has experience with IT convergence-contents was the experiment group, and the other group with no experience was the control group. In both groups, body functions, cognitive functions, activities of daily living and community participation were tested. The experimental group had higher scores for cognitive function, and activities of daily living than that of the control group. In conclusion, future studies can support continued IT convergence-contents at the local business community level rather than with smaller samples.

Nevertheless, most studies have been investigated the relationship between entrepreneurship and venture creation, and a few studies have analyzed the innovation and technological convergence of SMEs. The purpose of this research is to gain industrial insight into the technological convergence and to suggest a dynamic growth policy for entrepreneurs of SMEs to improve their convergence performance based on IT and BT. Therefore, we intend to propose solutions to these key questions in convergence such as; what are the key patterns in the process of technological convergence of SMEs on IT and BT, and what kinds of strategy do their need? In order to answer these research questions, we adopt network analysis using patent citation information. Results of network analysis revealed that building ecosystem based on government and universities is one of the most important factors for the future growth of SMEs in Korea. Also, the fit between technological convergence direction of SMEs and division of convergence structure of government and universities will be positively associated with dynamic growth of SMEs in Korea. In conclusion, this research extends the current studies on important aspects of SMEs in the technological convergence process by proposing their growth in convergence process to a newly converging context, IT and BT, and shed light on the integrative perspectives of crucial roles of SMEs on innovation performance in the IT and BT technological convergence., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201528764978526,","Title: Investigations on IT/ET and IT/BT Convergence Technology Using Power Line Communications, Abstract: Due to enhanced high IT (information technology) development, IT-based technology convergences such as IT/ET(electric technology), IT/BT(biology technology) and IT/NT(nano technology) are actively merging trend and their applications spread wide.

Combining vaccination effort with disruptive technology for compliance enforcement is an unarguable panacea. This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities. This innovation guarantees intuitive monitoring of vaccination progress and curtailment of COVID-19 spread through compliance enforcement., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13570757,","Title: Convergence of Energy and IT Sectors, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART133388413",38,1.1859924140007934,row_000039,"Title: 국방 IT융합 비즈니스 모델 사례와 성과 분석

국방 IT융합 비즈니스 모델 유형 및 핵심 프로세스

##서론##
국방 IT융합은 산업 전반의 핵심 동력으로 인식되며, 특히 국방 분야에서는 중요한 혁신 수단으로 활용되고 있습니다. 한국 정부는 2008년부터 IT융합 정책을 수립하여 자동차, 조선, 국방 등 핵심 산업에 적용해왔습니다. 이러한 국방 IT융합은 네트워크 중심전(Network Centric Warfare) 개념을 실현하고 국방 경영 효율화를 지원하며 미래 전장 운용 개념을 구현하는 데 필수적인 역할을 합니다.

##본론##

Patent analysis, including citation and co-classification analyses, was adopted as a main method to measure the convergence intensity and coverage, and two portfolio matrices were developed to manage the technological convergence. The contribution of this paper is that it provides practical evidences for IT-BT convergence, based on quantitative data and systematic processes. This has managerial implications for each sector of IT and BT., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201266833852356,","Title: Convergence IT 관련 기사, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART54596509,","Title: IT convergence and security, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART67385534,","Title: PHOTONICS IT CONVERGENCE - IT Korea, Shanghai EXPO, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201045340584669,","Title: IT/OT Convergence 기반의 Advanced Distribution Management System의 설계, Abstract: Power automation system to operate power distribution systems can be distinguished by distribution SCADA with remote monitoring and control; and distribution automation system with basic functions such as service restoration to the distribution SCADA; and distribution management system which is operated by various applications in order to enhance distribution system operation performance based on the distribution automation system.

How would you concisely summarize the key findings on using machine learning classifiers combined with molecular docking to predict cytochrome P450 ligand interactions?,"##Title## Integrative Machine Learning and Docking Approach for Predicting Cytochrome P450 Ligand Binding ##Introduction## Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes play a central role in the first-phase metabolism of drugs and xenobiotics, making accurate prediction of ligand–CYP interactions critical in early drug development. Traditional experimental screening of potential CYP substrates and inhibitors is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Combining fast, data-driven classification models with molecular docking offers a promising in silico strategy to forecast which compounds are likely to bind specific CYP isoforms. ##Main Body## Four machine learning classifiers—Laplacian-modified naïve Bayesian, random forest, recursive partitioning, and support vector machine—were trained on known ligands of the five major CYP isoenzymes responsible for over 80% of drug metabolism. All models achieved over 80% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, alongside statistically significant AUC and Matthews correlation coefficient values, confirming their robust discriminative power. Complementary docking studies then evaluated how representative substrates orient and interact within each CYP active site, predicting plausible binding modes and key contact residues. This dual workflow—classification to flag likely binders followed by docking to characterize their interaction geometries—provides both rapid screening and mechanistic insight. ##Conclusion## By integrating high-performing machine learning classifiers with molecular docking, this approach enables reliable prediction of CYP–ligand interactions and detailed hypotheses on binding mechanisms, streamlining early evaluation of drug candidates and helping prioritize compounds for experimental validation.",없음,없음,"Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

IT컨버전스는 개방과 공유, 참여를 통해 이용자를 서로 연결해주던 웹2.0의 진정한 실현과 개인에게 최적화된 정보를 제공해주는 웹3.0 시대로의 진입을 앞당길 것이다. 구현 기술이 관건이다. 컨버전스 시대의 진정한 구현을 뒷받침할 수 있는 기술 특징의 인식은 매우 중요하다. 기술의 방향은 컨버전스 시대에 부합하는 글로벌 표준화이어야 한다. 소개한 표준화 기술은 하드웨어와 소프트웨어, 네트워크 및 콘텐츠 상호 간 종속하지 않고 자유롭게 n-Screen과 5A를 구현하기 위한 것이 다.&nbsp;아울러 Convergence 시대에 맞는 새로운 법적 규율의 논의가 필요하다. 컨버전스 시대의 중요한 요소인 콘테츠를 통한 서비스는 국가와 기업, 개인 간의 관계를 변화시키고 있다. 따라서 각자의 역할 변화에 따른 법적 규율의 재정립이 필요하다. 무엇보다도 헌법 원리에 근거를 두어야 할 것이다. 이는 정보의 존중, 형성, 참여하는 민주주의의 동태적인 실현과, 공동체와 구성원들의 다양한 이익의 조화로운 실현을 위한 규범체계의 형성원리인 법치주의, 정보격차의 해소라는 측면에서의 복리주의를 담아야 함을 의미한다. IT관련 법적 규율 논의는 통제와 진흥, 활성화를 위한 방향이 되어야 한다. 법적 이슈 논의와 기술구현 방향이 설정되어야 할 것이다.

In addition, even though serious secu- rity breaches are often reported, small organizations still have to worry about security breaches as they can often be the target of viruses and phishing. This is why it is so important to ensure the privacy of your user profile in cyberspace. The past few years have seen a rise in machine learning algorithms that address major cybersecu- rity issues such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), detection of new modifications of known malware, malware, and spam detection, and malware analysis. In this arti- cle, algorithms have been analyzed using data mining collected from various libraries, and analytics with additional emerging data-driven models to provide more effective security solutions. In addition, an analysis was carried out of companies that are en- gaged in cyber attacks using machine learning. According to the research results, it was revealed that the concept of cybersecurity data science allows you to make the computing process more efficient and intelligent compared to traditional processes in the field of cybersecurity. As a result, according to the results of the study, it was revealed that machine learning, namely unsupervised learning, is an effective method of dealing with risks in cybersecurity and cyberattacks., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART118582509,","Title: Topology optimization via machine learning and deep learning: a review, Abstract: Topology optimization (TO) is a method of deriving an optimal design that satisfies a given load and boundary conditions within a design domain. This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003008557,","Title: &#x201e;Machine learning“ in der An&auml;sthesiologie, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART108282335,","Title: Machine Learning na Medicina: Revis&atilde;o e Aplicabilidade, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117822080,","Title: Digitalisierung der Handsortierung durch K&uuml;nstliche Intelligenz, Machine Learning und Human Machine Interaction, Abstract: AbstractWaste management is transforming into a manufacturing industry in the circular economy. Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). AI and ML have repeatedly shown how they revolutionise entire industries and sectors. The RecAIcle project focuses on plastic and battery characterisation and sorting. Thus, the productivity and quality of manual sorting are to be increased, and a digital assistance system that supports sorting employees in their sorting decisions is being developed for this purpose. Due to the unique requirements of such a system, the framework design was adapted accordingly. For the development of this system, advanced, life-long learning ML models are needed, which in turn require large amounts of high-quality training data and computing power. In order to provide sufficient use-case-specific training data, experiments were carried out under controlled conditions on a pilot plant scale for training data acquisition.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Machine Learning in Predicting Hemoglobin Variants, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART93885082,","Title: Wine Quality Evaluation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: There are many prediction systems available for problems like stock exchange, medical diagnosis, insurance calculation, etc. Wine Quality is one area where there is a big opportunity to recommend a good quality of wine to users based on their preferences as well as in historical data.

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002921834,","Title: Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Intensive Care Units, Abstract: Abstract Intensive care is an ideal environment for the use of Big Data Analysis (BDA) and Machine Learning (ML), due to the huge amount of information processed and stored in electronic format in relation to such care.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Machine Learning기법을 이용한 Robot 이상 예지 보전, Abstract: In this paper, a predictive maintenance of the robot trouble using the machine learning method, so called MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi), was studied.

It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session.

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident.

The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper.

Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism.

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

##Introduction##
The integration of machine learning (ML) classifiers with molecular docking techniques has emerged as a powerful computational approach for predicting cytochrome P450 (CYP450) ligand interactions. This hybrid methodology aims to overcome the limitations of traditional experimental methods, which are often resource- and time-intensive, and to enhance the accuracy of *in silico* predictions crucial for early-stage drug discovery.

##Main Body##
The key findings highlight the significant advantages and improved performance of this combined approach. Hybrid machine learning frameworks, which incorporate molecular docking-derived parameters alongside ligand and protein descriptors, have demonstrated superior predictive accuracy in cross-validation compared to using stand-alone molecular docking or purely ligand-based methods. For instance, models evaluated on CYP1A2 and CYP17A1 isoforms showed enhanced performance in binding prediction when benchmarked against state-of-the-art tools like SwissADME and ADMETlab 3.0. Furthermore, various machine learning classifiers, including Laplacian-modified naïve Bayesian, random forest, recursive partitioning, and support vector machines, have achieved very high levels of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, ROC, and MCC in classifying CYP inhibitors, providing reliable predictions on validation datasets. This computational efficiency is particularly valuable in drug development, as it allows for the early detection of potential CYP inhibitors, thereby reducing significant costs and time associated with later-stage failures.

Despite these advancements, several limitations and challenges persist. Traditional molecular docking programs often struggle with inaccurate scoring functions and may not adequately account for the dynamic flexibility of target proteins, leading to reduced accuracy in predicting optimal ligand poses and binding affinities. Studies have shown that predicted receptor protein conformational changes in the backbone and side chains of binding site residues can result in large structural deviations in ligand binding predictions. Moreover, the accuracy of binding affinity and structure prediction can be influenced by specific ligand properties. For example, some docking tools may underestimate binding affinities for ligands with a high number of torsions, and prediction efficiency can be lower for hydrophobic ligands or those lacking ring structures, indicating that current scoring functions may not accurately evaluate all complex molecular interactions.

##Conclusion##
In summary, combining machine learning classifiers with molecular docking offers a highly effective and efficient strategy for predicting CYP450 ligand interactions, significantly improving predictive accuracy and streamlining early drug discovery processes. While this hybrid approach provides substantial benefits over individual methods, ongoing challenges related to docking score accuracy, protein flexibility, and the precise evaluation of diverse ligand properties necessitate further research and refinement to maximize its potential.",0.6758
Could you outline the main points about the role of large-scale machine learning in bridging database systems and commercial applications?,"##Large-Scale Machine Learning and Commercial Applications## ##Introduction## The integration of machine learning with database technologies has shifted from a purely academic endeavor to a cornerstone of modern commercial and scientific systems. As data volumes grow into the tera-scale range, quality modeling increasingly depends on the ability to process and learn from massive datasets. Bridging database systems and real-world applications therefore requires not only new algorithms but also scalable infrastructures and standardized workflows. ##Main Body## Large-scale machine learning applications today rely on distributed storage and parallel computing frameworks tightly coupled with database engines to handle high-velocity, high-volume data. Typical workflows start with data ingestion and cleaning within a database environment, proceed to feature extraction and model training across compute clusters, and culminate in model deployment back into operational systems for real-time prediction or batch scoring. Current systems support—such as MapReduce, distributed SQL engines, and specialized ML libraries—address many scaling challenges, but critical gaps remain. In particular, there is no universally accepted life-cycle process for productionizing models (akin to CRISP-DM in data mining), leading to ad hoc integration, limited reuse, and operational bottlenecks. Moreover, emerging advances in ML research (e.g., streaming models, adaptive learning) demand new database primitives for incremental updates, low-latency inference, and co-optimization of storage and computation. ##Conclusion## To fully bridge database systems and commercial applications, future work must deliver unified platforms that support both established ML use cases and cutting-edge research. Standardized life-cycle processes, tighter DB-ML integration, and extensible infrastructures will be key to operationalizing large-scale learning at enterprise scale.",없음,없음,"Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO.

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI).

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data.

To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002764866,","Title: Machine learning in oncology-Perspectives in patient-reported outcome research, Abstract: AbstractBackgroundIncreasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART116697768,","Title: MACHINE LEARNING, Abstract: The motivation for machine learning is to have computers extract concepts and relations from databases or through interactive sessions with a user and then use them in any knowledge-intensive activity. Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism. We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results. We, therefore, suggest that it further expands the role of science in terrorism research., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART94298406,","Title: A Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods, Abstract: The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117389222,","Title: Liver Fibrosis Biomarker Validation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: Background: Liver fibrosis which causes several liver diseases, requires early screening and management. The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

##Introduction##
Large-scale machine learning (ML) has emerged as a critical technology for connecting database systems with commercial applications. This synergy is driven by the exponential growth of data and the need for advanced analytical capabilities to extract actionable insights. ML models leverage the vast and diverse datasets stored in database systems to power intelligent functionalities, thereby enhancing efficiency, performance, and strategic value across various industries.

##Main Body##
The role of large-scale machine learning in bridging database systems and commercial applications can be outlined through several key points:

1.  **Database Systems as the Foundation for ML Data**:
    *   **Data Provision**: Database systems are fundamental in supplying the ""massive amounts of data"" and ""large, high-quality data sets"" essential for training robust machine learning models (JAKO202375343265966).
    *   **Diverse Data Types**: They manage and store a wide array of data relevant for ML, including both ""structured and unstructured data."" This encompasses personal information, consumption patterns, location data, data generated by Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, web documents, emails, social data, time-series data (e.g., weather, vital signs), medical images, and genomic data (JAKO201409150679222, NART98451950, NPAP12688093, JAKO201503340570903, NART97710485, DIKO0015936637, JAKO202514057605142).
    *   **Big Data Infrastructure**: Modern database environments, including distributed systems like Apache Hadoop and NoSQL, are crucial for handling the ""volume, velocity, and variety"" of big data, making it accessible and processable for ML (JAKO201424635079777, NPAP12636301, NART98451950, DIKO0013392225).

2.  **ML's Enhancement of Database Systems and Data Flow**:
    *   **Improved Database Components**: AI and ML techniques are applied to improve various components of database systems themselves. This leads to ""substantial savings of resources and computation time,"" and significantly enhances ""system performance and efficiency"" (JAKO202375343265966).
    *   **Efficient Data Processing**: ML utilizes big data processing frameworks (e.g., MapReduce, Spark) to efficiently process and analyze large datasets. Techniques like patterned compression can reduce CPU usage, memory consumption, and processing time, improving the overall efficiency of data preparation for ML applications (JAKO201833469089907, JAKO201631642279380, JAKO202514057605142).
    *   **Data Interoperability and Integration**: ML benefits from and drives the development of systems that integrate heterogeneous databases and data sources. Concepts like federated database systems and data virtualization facilitate a unified view of data, which is vital for comprehensive ML analysis (JAKO199811921340072, ATN0024933735, ATN0037461993, JAKO200835054210184).
    *   **Automated Feature Extraction**: Deep learning can automate the complex and iterative process of feature extraction from raw transaction data, which is critical for improving ML model performance and reducing manual effort in preparing data for commercial applications (JAKO201924064455520).

3.  **Bridging to Commercial Applications through ML-driven Insights and Functionalities**:
    *   **Predictive Analytics**: Large-scale ML enables accurate predictions across diverse commercial applications:
        *   **Business Optimization**: It supports ""real-time data stream processing and predictive analysis"" for optimizing business processes, forecasting demand, and predicting equipment failures in industrial automation (DIKO0016958889).
        *   **Healthcare**: ML aids in supporting diagnoses, predicting disease prognosis (e.g., ischemic stroke), and improving the quality of care based on large medical datasets (JAKO202307361686821).
        *   **Financial Markets**: ML models are used for stock prediction by analyzing various data types (JAKO202131559470407).
        *   **Customer Behavior**: ML algorithms analyze user transaction patterns to provide ""product recommendations"" and ""sales forecasting"" (JAKO201536553093556).
    *   **Personalized Services**: By processing vast amounts of user data (e.g., log data, user information, service application history), ML algorithms like autoencoders create ""personalized product recommendation systems,"" enhancing user experience and fostering customer loyalty (DIKO0017154536).
    *   **Enhanced Decision-Making**: ML provides ""problem-solving ability and predictive ability"" to address business challenges, improve competitiveness, and support ""strategic decision-making"" by transforming data into valuable insights (DIKO0013413499, NART102773225).

What are the core contributions of spatial and temporal adaptation techniques in machine learning–based scheduling knowledge acquisition?,"##Machine Learning–Based Scheduling Knowledge Acquisition with Spatial and Temporal Adaptation## ##Introduction## Effective scheduling in manufacturing relies on dispatching rules that adapt to changing system states over time. Traditional machine learning approaches have focused primarily on temporal adaptation, selecting optimal rules based solely on system state dynamics. Introducing spatial adaptation—where each machine tailors its rule choice by considering neighboring machines—promises further productivity gains. ##Main Body## This study formalizes two adaptation concepts: temporal adaptation (choosing rules as system states evolve) and spatial adaptation (each machine accounts for its own and adjacent machines’ rule effects). To capture these adaptations, the authors propose (1) a Taguchi-based systematic experiment design that incrementally uncovers robust dispatching rule combinations and (2) a coevolutionary genetic algorithm (GA) that evolves flexible rule sets across machine populations. In a stable semiconductor reentrant flow, the Taguchi method identified rule combinations that outperformed heuristics and maintained robustness under noise. For more dynamic fuel-transfer manufacturing, extending Taguchi to spatial–temporal adaptation yielded improved strategies but at considerable computational cost. The coevolutionary GA addresses this by encoding rule options per machine population and introducing a fitness evaluation combining zero-order (baseline performance) and first-order (performance sensitivity) measures; this innovation mitigates interpopulation ripples and speeds convergence. Comparative experiments show the GA delivers high-quality solutions rapidly, while the Taguchi procedure offers valuable insights into decision processes. ##Conclusion## Integrating spatial and temporal adaptations enhances scheduling rule learning by accounting for both dynamic changes and intermachine interactions. The Taguchi approach provides robust, noise-resilient rule combinations and educates experts on decision logic, whereas the coevolutionary GA dramatically reduces learning time and yields flexible, high-performance strategies. Together, these contributions advance automated knowledge acquisition for complex scheduling environments.",없음,없음,"Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI).

The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Machine Learning in Predicting Hemoglobin Variants, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART93885082,","Title: Wine Quality Evaluation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: There are many prediction systems available for problems like stock exchange, medical diagnosis, insurance calculation, etc. Wine Quality is one area where there is a big opportunity to recommend a good quality of wine to users based on their preferences as well as in historical data.

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002921834,","Title: Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Intensive Care Units, Abstract: Abstract Intensive care is an ideal environment for the use of Big Data Analysis (BDA) and Machine Learning (ML), due to the huge amount of information processed and stored in electronic format in relation to such care.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Machine Learning기법을 이용한 Robot 이상 예지 보전, Abstract: In this paper, a predictive maintenance of the robot trouble using the machine learning method, so called MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi), was studied.

It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches.

Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism. We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results.

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

###Introduction###
Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly vital for the effective and efficient acquisition of knowledge required in developing knowledge-based scheduling systems. Traditional ML approaches often focus on temporal adaptation, where knowledge is acquired to determine optimal dispatching rules based on system states that evolve over time. However, recent research has expanded to include spatial adaptation and combined spatial-temporal adaptation, offering significant contributions to optimizing system productivity and knowledge acquisition processes.

###Main Body###
The core contributions of spatial and temporal adaptation techniques in machine learning-based scheduling knowledge acquisition can be summarized as follows:

*   **Temporal Adaptation**: This technique focuses on acquiring knowledge to identify effective dispatching rules that adapt to the changing states of a production system over time. It addresses the dynamic nature of scheduling by ensuring that the rules used are optimal for the current system status.

*   **Spatial Adaptation**: This concept introduces the idea that each machine in a system should not only consider its own state but also the dispatching rules of surrounding machines to find the most optimal scheduling rules. This allows for a more holistic and coordinated approach to scheduling across interconnected components of a system.

*   **Combined Spatial-Temporal Adaptation**: By integrating both spatial and temporal adaptation, this approach aims to optimize system productivity by using strategies that adapt to both the evolving states of individual machines and their interactions within the broader system over time.

*   **Knowledge Acquisition Methods**:
    *   **Systematic Experimental Design (e.g., Taguchi Method)**: This method enables the step-by-step acquisition of scheduling knowledge for spatial and spatial-temporal adaptation. In applications like semiconductor fabrication, it has demonstrated superior performance and robustness against various noise conditions compared to traditional heuristic rules. While it can be time-consuming and lead to strategies with limited flexibility, the decision-making process derived from this approach is highly educational for human experts, aiding in the analysis and accumulation of scheduling expertise for automated knowledge extraction.
    *   **Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithms**: This advanced method offers a more efficient and flexible way to acquire knowledge for both spatial and spatial-temporal adaptation. It can achieve better solutions faster than the Taguchi method, significantly reducing the learning time. Furthermore, it includes novel evaluation methods designed to overcome challenges such as high variability and ripple effects often encountered in coevolutionary processes, thereby enhancing the quality of the solutions.

###Conclusion###
Spatial and temporal adaptation techniques, particularly when combined, significantly enhance machine learning-based scheduling knowledge acquisition by enabling systems to dynamically adjust to both individual machine states and the broader operational environment. While systematic experimental designs like the Taguchi method provide robust, albeit sometimes time-consuming, knowledge, coevolutionary genetic algorithms offer a faster and more flexible alternative, leading to improved scheduling performance and efficiency. These adaptive strategies are crucial for developing intelligent scheduling systems that can effectively manage complex and dynamic production environments.",0.6758
How does the audiovisual speech recognition approach integrate hidden Markov models and neural networks to achieve robustness in noisy environments?,"##Audiovisual Speech Recognition Approach## ##Introduction## Audiovisual speech recognition leverages both acoustic signals and visual cues from lip movements to overcome the severe performance drop of conventional audio‐only systems in noisy environments. By treating visual information as a noise‐immune complement to audio, the approach is partitioned into three core components—visual recognition, auditory modeling, and multimodal fusion—to enhance overall robustness. ##Main Body## First, the visual subsystem refines hidden Markov models (HMMs) through a hybrid probabilistic optimization algorithm. It integrates simulated annealing with local search operators to escape local maxima of the likelihood function, ensuring a more global exploration of HMM parameters and faster convergence for modeling lip‐movement sequences. Second, the auditory subsystem extends standard HMMs by explicitly modeling inter‐frame correlations within the speech signal. Instead of treating frames independently, a Gaussian mixture framework captures joint distributions of consecutive feature vectors, and a tailored expectation–maximization procedure estimates parameters that better reflect temporal dependencies, thereby improving noise resilience. Third, the fusion stage employs a neural network that learns to weight the outputs of audio‐only and visual‐only recognizers. Trained on mixed‐noise data without prior noise‐level knowledge, this network dynamically adjusts modality weights to maximize recognition accuracy, producing results that consistently match or exceed the best single‐modality output and exploit cross‐modal synergy. ##Conclusion## By combining globally optimized HMMs for visual processing, inter‐frame‐aware acoustic models, and adaptive neural‐network–based fusion, the audiovisual system achieves robust speech recognition under diverse and unknown noise conditions. This tri-part integration harnesses the complementary strengths of auditory and visual modalities, resulting in significant and reliable performance gains in noisy environments.",없음,없음,"Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

Big Data is an enabler, as large and high-quality data are always the basis for successful machine learning algorithms and models. There is currently no fully established standard process for the machine learning life cycle, as is the case in data mining with the CRISP-DM-Process, which means that the operationalization of machine learning models in particular can present companies with major challenges. In this article, the implications for data management in companies are worked out on the basis of the view of the nature of the data, the various roles in machine learning teams and the life cycle of machine learning models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101894389,","Title: Enhanced Machine Learning Algorithms: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Q-Learning, Abstract: In recent years, machine learning algorithms are continuously being used and expanded in various fields, such as facial recognition, signal processing, personal authentication, and stock prediction.

In addition, even though serious secu- rity breaches are often reported, small organizations still have to worry about security breaches as they can often be the target of viruses and phishing. This is why it is so important to ensure the privacy of your user profile in cyberspace. The past few years have seen a rise in machine learning algorithms that address major cybersecu- rity issues such as intrusion detection systems (IDS), detection of new modifications of known malware, malware, and spam detection, and malware analysis. In this arti- cle, algorithms have been analyzed using data mining collected from various libraries, and analytics with additional emerging data-driven models to provide more effective security solutions. In addition, an analysis was carried out of companies that are en- gaged in cyber attacks using machine learning.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO. In addition, the limitations of current MLTO research and future research directions are examined., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003008557,","Title: &#x201e;Machine learning“ in der An&auml;sthesiologie, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART108282335,","Title: Machine Learning na Medicina: Revis&atilde;o e Aplicabilidade, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117822080,","Title: Digitalisierung der Handsortierung durch K&uuml;nstliche Intelligenz, Machine Learning und Human Machine Interaction, Abstract: AbstractWaste management is transforming into a manufacturing industry in the circular economy. Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). AI and ML have repeatedly shown how they revolutionise entire industries and sectors. The RecAIcle project focuses on plastic and battery characterisation and sorting. Thus, the productivity and quality of manual sorting are to be increased, and a digital assistance system that supports sorting employees in their sorting decisions is being developed for this purpose. Due to the unique requirements of such a system, the framework design was adapted accordingly. For the development of this system, advanced, life-long learning ML models are needed, which in turn require large amounts of high-quality training data and computing power. In order to provide sufficient use-case-specific training data, experiments were carried out under controlled conditions on a pilot plant scale for training data acquisition.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Machine Learning in Predicting Hemoglobin Variants, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART93885082,","Title: Wine Quality Evaluation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: There are many prediction systems available for problems like stock exchange, medical diagnosis, insurance calculation, etc. Wine Quality is one area where there is a big opportunity to recommend a good quality of wine to users based on their preferences as well as in historical data.

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002921834,","Title: Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Intensive Care Units, Abstract: Abstract Intensive care is an ideal environment for the use of Big Data Analysis (BDA) and Machine Learning (ML), due to the huge amount of information processed and stored in electronic format in relation to such care.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Machine Learning기법을 이용한 Robot 이상 예지 보전, Abstract: In this paper, a predictive maintenance of the robot trouble using the machine learning method, so called MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi), was studied.

It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response.

To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper.

Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism.

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

##Introduction##
Audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR) aims to overcome the limitations of traditional speech recognition systems in noisy environments by integrating both auditory and visual cues. While conventional speech recognition systems often struggle with performance degradation in the presence of noise, AVSR leverages the complementary nature of speech and lip movements to enhance robustness. This is achieved through sophisticated integration techniques involving Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Neural Networks (NNs), which combine their respective strengths in temporal modeling, pattern recognition, and information fusion.

##Main Body##
The integration of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Neural Networks (NNs) in audiovisual speech recognition (AVSR) to achieve robustness in noisy environments is multifaceted, primarily involving hybrid modeling, adaptation, and information fusion.

**1. Role of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs):**
HMMs are fundamental for modeling the temporal dynamics of speech. In AVSR, HMMs serve several key functions:
*   **Temporal Modeling:** HMMs are adept at representing the sequential nature of speech, capturing the dynamic characteristics of both acoustic and visual (lip movement) signals over time (Doc 2, 6, 11).
*   **Visual Information Recognition:** HMMs can act as recognizers for visual information, with probabilistic optimization algorithms (e.g., hybrid simulated annealing and local search) proposed to enhance their performance in this domain (Doc 1).
*   **Acoustic Robustness:** For auditory processing, HMMs are used to model inter-frame correlations, often employing Gaussian mixture models to handle the joint probability distribution of different frames. This helps in making acoustic recognition more robust against noise (Doc 1).
*   **Score Computation:** HMMs can compute Viterbi output scores, which represent the likelihood of a given observation sequence belonging to a particular model (Doc 5).

**2. Role of Neural Networks (NNs):**
Neural Networks contribute significantly to AVSR's robustness, particularly in feature extraction, classification, and complex pattern mapping:
*   **Feature Integration and Compensation:** NNs are highly effective at fusing diverse information sources. For instance, a BiModal Neural Network (BMNN) can integrate speech and visual features, with specific layers designed to compensate for the loss of speech information due to noise (Doc 3).
*   **Adaptive Weighting for Fusion:** In the information integration stage, trained neural networks can output appropriate combination weights for the recognition results derived from visual and auditory streams. This is crucial when the type and level of noise are unknown, allowing the system to dynamically adjust the reliance on each modality to achieve optimal recognition (Doc 1, 8). This ""integrated reliability"" considers both acoustic noise and model confusability (Doc 8).
*   **HMM Adaptation:** NNs can be used to adapt HMMs to noisy speech by mapping clean speech HMMs to noise-adapted HMMs, using noise HMMs and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as inputs. This direct adaptation mechanism improves HMM performance in varying noise conditions (Doc 4).
*   **Emission Probability Estimation:** Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), can estimate the a posteriori probabilities, which are then utilized as emission probabilities for HMM states. This approach offers superior discrimination and the ability to incorporate multiple features and temporal context without restrictive statistical assumptions (Doc 6, 7).
*   **Dynamic Prediction for HMM States:** Hybrid networks like the Neural Network Predictive HMM (NPHMM) define a predictive neural network for each HMM state. These NNs provide dynamically changing predictions based on past feature vectors, replacing static mean vectors and thereby enhancing the HMM's capacity to model the dynamic, time-variant characteristics of speech, which is vital for noise robustness (Doc 11, 27).
*   **Feature Normalization Mapping:** NNs can estimate a normalization mapping between noisy and clean features, which is then fed into the acoustic model, leading to significant reductions in word error rates in noisy environments (Doc 12).

**3. Integration Mechanisms for Robustness:**
The integration of HMMs and NNs typically occurs through hybrid architectures that leverage the strengths of both:
*   **Hybrid HMM-NN Systems:** These systems combine HMMs for their sequential modeling capabilities with NNs for their powerful discriminative abilities and capacity to handle complex, non-linear relationships. For example, HMMs might provide the temporal structure, while NNs estimate the observation probabilities for each HMM state (Doc 6, 7).
*   **Cascaded Architectures:** In some approaches, HMMs might perform an initial pass to generate scores or hypotheses, which are then refined or classified by NNs (Doc 5).
*   **Feature-Level Fusion:** NNs can directly fuse raw or processed auditory and visual features into a combined representation before or during the HMM decoding process (Doc 3).
*   **Decision-Level Fusion:** NNs can also be used at a higher level to combine the outputs or confidence scores from separate auditory and visual recognition modules (each potentially HMM-based) to make a final, more robust decision (Doc 1, 8).

##Conclusion##
By integrating Hidden Markov Models and Neural Networks, audiovisual speech recognition systems achieve enhanced robustness in noisy environments. HMMs provide a strong framework for modeling the temporal sequences of speech and visual cues, while NNs offer superior capabilities in feature extraction, non-linear mapping, and intelligent information fusion. This synergistic combination allows the system to adapt to varying noise conditions, compensate for degraded speech signals, and leverage the complementary nature of auditory and visual information, ultimately leading to significantly improved recognition performance in challenging real-world scenarios.",0.6758

The convergence of machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), neuroimaging, and multi-omics data has emerged as a transformative approach to uncover the complex patterns driving individual drug response. ##Main Body## Researchers apply a variety of ML algorithms—such as random forests, support vector machines, and neural networks—alongside DL architectures to integrate genomic variants, transcriptomic profiles, and imaging-derived features. These models have successfully predicted patient outcomes, highlighted potential biomarkers, and enhanced patient stratification for specific antidepressants. Neuroimaging pharmacogenomics extends this work by correlating brain activity signatures with genetic data, boosting prediction performance and shedding light on underlying biological mechanisms. However, standardizing heterogeneous datasets, ensuring model interpretability, and overcoming limited sample sizes remain key challenges for broad clinical adoption. ##Conclusion## By melding ML and DL techniques with comprehensive multi-omics and neuroimaging datasets, researchers are forging a path toward more accurate antidepressant response predictions and biomarker discovery.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO.

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). AI and ML have repeatedly shown how they revolutionise entire industries and sectors. The RecAIcle project focuses on plastic and battery characterisation and sorting.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data.

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002921834,","Title: Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Intensive Care Units, Abstract: Abstract Intensive care is an ideal environment for the use of Big Data Analysis (BDA) and Machine Learning (ML), due to the huge amount of information processed and stored in electronic format in relation to such care.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Machine Learning기법을 이용한 Robot 이상 예지 보전, Abstract: In this paper, a predictive maintenance of the robot trouble using the machine learning method, so called MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi), was studied. Especially, 'MD(Mahalanobis Distance)' was used to compare the robot arm motion difference between before the maintenance(bearing change) and after the maintenance. 6-axies vibration sensor was used to detect the vibration sensing during the motion of the robot arm. The results of the comparison, MD value of the arm motions of the after the maintenance(bearing change) was much lower and stable compared to MD value of the arm motions of the before the maintenance. MD value well distinguished the fine difference of the arm vibration of the robot. The superior performance of the MT method applied to the prediction of the robot trouble was verified by this experiments., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202011161035055,","Title: Speech Recognition using Machine Learning, Abstract: Speech recognition is one of the fastest-growing engineering technologies. It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation. This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002724517,","Title: Comparison of Machine Learning Tools for Mobile Application, Abstract: Demand for machine learning systems continues to grow, and cloud machine learning platforms are widely used to meet this demand.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002764866,","Title: Machine learning in oncology-Perspectives in patient-reported outcome research, Abstract: AbstractBackgroundIncreasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART116697768,","Title: MACHINE LEARNING, Abstract: The motivation for machine learning is to have computers extract concepts and relations from databases or through interactive sessions with a user and then use them in any knowledge-intensive activity. Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism. We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results. We, therefore, suggest that it further expands the role of science in terrorism research., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART94298406,","Title: A Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods, Abstract: The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few.

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

##Introduction##
The pharmacogenomics of antidepressant treatments aims to personalize therapy for patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) due to significant variability in treatment response and the prevalence of adverse effects. Traditional trial-and-error approaches often lead to delays in effective treatment and can result in severe side effects. The core essence of applying various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches in this field is to overcome these limitations by leveraging complex biological data to predict individual patient responses, identify biomarkers, and ultimately enable more precise and effective personalized medicine.

##Main Body##
Machine and deep learning techniques serve as a vital foundation for advancing pharmacogenomics research in antidepressant treatment prediction. Their application is essential for several key reasons:

1.  **Handling High-Dimensional and Multi-Omics Data:** Pharmacogenomics research involves vast amounts of high-dimensional genetic variables, including genomic variants, neuroimaging data, and multi-omics data (Document 1, 4). ML and DL algorithms are uniquely suited to process and analyze these complex, large-scale datasets, which traditional statistical methods often struggle with. They can identify intricate patterns and correlations within this data that are indicative of drug response.

2.  **Predicting Treatment Outcomes and Biomarkers:** A primary goal is to accurately predict individual drug responsiveness, treatment outcomes, and potential biomarkers for antidepressant treatments in MDD (Document 1, 3, 4). ML and DL models are leveraged to build predictive models that can assess the chances of response to antidepressants and anticipate adverse reactions and drug metabolism levels based on an individual's genetic profile (Document 3). For instance, studies utilize various ML approaches to predict antidepressant treatment outcomes by integrating pharmacogenomics and neuroimaging research (Document 1).

3.  **Enabling Personalized Medicine:** The application of ML and DL facilitates the shift from a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to personalized medicine. By using genetic information to guide drug choice, these methods aim to optimize antidepressant therapy, improve clinical results, and reduce healthcare costs (Document 2, 3). This moves beyond the traditional trial-and-error practice, allowing clinicians to make individualized treatment decisions (Document 3).

4.  **Overcoming Limitations of Past Research:** ML and DL help address the limitations observed in past pharmacogenomics studies of antidepressant treatments (Document 1). For example, in pharmacogenomics research, where the number of variables is high, variable selection is crucial, and ML algorithms are used to build effective prediction models (Document 4). The integration of pharmacogenomic data with other factors like family history can provide comprehensive strategies for optimizing treatment (Document 2).

##Conclusion##
In essence, the application of machine and deep learning to pharmacogenomics research for antidepressant treatment prediction is about transforming the therapeutic landscape for depression. These advanced computational approaches enable the comprehensive analysis of complex genetic and multi-omics data, leading to more accurate predictions of individual treatment response, the identification of crucial biomarkers, and the development of truly personalized medicine. This data-driven paradigm promises to significantly improve the efficacy and safety of antidepressant treatments, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and reducing the burden of major depressive disorder.",0.6758

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO.

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI).

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data.

To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART116697768,","Title: MACHINE LEARNING, Abstract: The motivation for machine learning is to have computers extract concepts and relations from databases or through interactive sessions with a user and then use them in any knowledge-intensive activity. Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism. We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results. We, therefore, suggest that it further expands the role of science in terrorism research., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART94298406,","Title: A Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods, Abstract: The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117389222,","Title: Liver Fibrosis Biomarker Validation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: Background: Liver fibrosis which causes several liver diseases, requires early screening and management. The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

While existing studies have mainly focused on temporal adaptation, this study suggests two methods that implement spatial adaptation and space-time adaptation and time adaptation that considers the interaction between machines. ## Main ## The first method is to systematically obtain the optimal work assignment rules of each machine in step through the Taguchi Experimental Planning Act. The semiconductor consistency was applied to public and fuel transmission system manufacturing systems to confirm higher performance and strength compared to the Hurricial rules. The second method is a technique for simultaneous evolution of the rules candidate groups of each machine using the CoEVOLUTIONARY Genetic Algorithm, shortening the learning time and creating a flexible strategy. The individual suitability evaluation was defined as a function of 0 -based performance (existing performance) and one -stage performance (contribution to the first change) to alleviate severe fluctuations and wave effects, and demonstrated experimental harm compared to tagging methods. ##conclusion## The Taguchi Experimental Planning Act is advantageous for professional education by providing a stable and interpretable rules combination, and the resonating genetic algorithm is excellent in terms of learning speed and flexibility. Both approaches were confirmed that it was an effective way to acquire knowledge -based knowledge -based knowledge that can contribute to productivity improvement through spatial and time adaptation.","Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives.

Due to the unique requirements of such a system, the framework design was adapted accordingly. For the development of this system, advanced, life-long learning ML models are needed, which in turn require large amounts of high-quality training data and computing power. In order to provide sufficient use-case-specific training data, experiments were carried out under controlled conditions on a pilot plant scale for training data acquisition. The results of the system design process and the first training data acquisition are presented in this paper. An outlook on future developments and further planned trials is also given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART128227262,","Title: Wave data prediction with optimized machine learning and deep learning techniques, Abstract: Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships are in the development stage and they play an important role in the upcoming future. Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Machine Learning in Predicting Hemoglobin Variants, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART93885082,","Title: Wine Quality Evaluation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: There are many prediction systems available for problems like stock exchange, medical diagnosis, insurance calculation, etc. Wine Quality is one area where there is a big opportunity to recommend a good quality of wine to users based on their preferences as well as in historical data.

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002921834,","Title: Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Intensive Care Units, Abstract: Abstract Intensive care is an ideal environment for the use of Big Data Analysis (BDA) and Machine Learning (ML), due to the huge amount of information processed and stored in electronic format in relation to such care.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Machine Learning기법을 이용한 Robot 이상 예지 보전, Abstract: In this paper, a predictive maintenance of the robot trouble using the machine learning method, so called MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi), was studied.

It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches.

Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism. We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results.

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

지식 기반 스케줄링에서 공간적·시간적 적응을 구현하는 기계학습 방법들의 주요 특징

##서론##
지식 기반 스케줄링 시스템의 개발에 있어 효과적이고 효율적인 지식 획득은 매우 중요하며, 이를 위해 귀납적 학습, 신경회로망, 유전자 알고리즘 등 다양한 기계학습 기법이 활발히 연구되고 있습니다. 특히, 생산 시스템의 동적인 특성을 고려하여 시스템 생산성을 최적화하기 위해서는 공간적·시간적 적응 전략의 도입이 필수적입니다. 본 문서에서는 지식 기반 스케줄링에서 공간적·시간적 적응을 구현하는 주요 기계학습 방법들의 특징을 요약합니다.

##본론##
지식 기반 스케줄링에서 공간적·시간적 적응을 구현하는 기계학습 방법들은 크게 두 가지 접근 방식으로 나눌 수 있습니다: 다구치 방법(Taguchi method)을 통한 체계적인 실험 계획과 공진화 유전자 알고리즘(coevolutionary genetic algorithm)을 통한 효율적인 지식 획득입니다.

**1. 시간적 적응 (Temporal Adaptation)**
시간적 적응은 시스템 상태가 시간에 따라 변화함에 따라 효과적인 작업 배정 규칙(dispatching rule)을 결정하는 지식을 획득하고 사용하는 것에 중점을 둡니다. 이는 시스템의 동적인 특성에 대응하여 스케줄링 전략을 유연하게 조정하는 것을 목표로 합니다.

**2. 공간적 적응 (Spatial Adaptation)**
공간적 적응은 각 기계가 자신의 상황뿐만 아니라 주변 기계들의 작업 배정 규칙까지 고려하여 최적의 작업 배정 규칙을 찾는 개념입니다. 이는 개별 요소의 최적화뿐만 아니라 시스템 전체의 상호작용을 통한 최적화를 추구합니다.

**3. 공간-시간적 적응 (Spatial-Temporal Adaptation)**
공간-시간적 적응은 시간적 적응과 공간적 적응을 통합하여 시스템의 동적인 특성과 공간적 상호작용을 동시에 고려하는 전략입니다. 이를 구현하기 위한 주요 기계학습 방법들의 특징은 다음과 같습니다.

*   **다구치 방법 (Taguchi Method):**
    *   **체계적인 지식 획득:** 체계적인 실험 계획을 통해 각 기계의 최적 작업 배정 규칙을 단계적으로 획득합니다.
    *   **강건한 성능:** 잘 알려진 휴리스틱 규칙에 비해 우수한 수행도를 보이며, 다양한 잡음 조건에도 강건함(robustness)을 나타내는 작업 배정 규칙 조합을 찾습니다.
    *   **확장성 및 한계:** 공간적응에서 좋은 수행도를 보였으며, 공간-시간적 적응으로 확장 시 향상된 전략을 생성할 수 있습니다. 그러나 학습에 많은 시간이 소요되어 유연성이 제한적인 전략으로 귀결될 수 있습니다.
    *   **교육적 가치:** 의사결정 과정이 인간 전문가에게 교육적이며, 스케줄링 전문 지식 분석 및 축적을 위한 자동화된 지식 추출에 유익합니다.

*   **공진화 유전자 알고리즘 (Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm):**
    *   **효율적이고 유연한 지식 획득:** 다구치 방법에 비해 더 좋은 해를 더 빨리 얻을 수 있어 학습 시간을 단축시킵니다.
    *   **집단 기반 최적화:** 각 집단(population)에 한 기계에서 사용 가능한 작업 배정 규칙들의 대안들이 코딩되어 공진화 과정을 거칩니다.
    *   **변동성 및 파동 효과 극복:** 평가에서의 심한 변동(high variability)과 이웃하는 집단 간의 파동 효과(ripple effects)로 인해 공진화 과정이 방해받는 문제를 극복하기 위해 새로운 평가 방법을 개발했습니다.
    *   **적합도 결정:** 각 개체(individual)의 적합도(fitness)는 시스템 수행도의 0계 수행도(zero-order performance)와 1계 수행도(first-order performance)의 함수로서 결정됩니다.

##결론##
지식 기반 스케줄링에서 공간적·시간적 적응을 구현하는 기계학습 방법들은 시스템의 동적인 변화와 복잡한 상호작용에 효과적으로 대응하기 위해 발전해왔습니다. 다구치 방법은 체계적인 지식 획득과 강건한 성능을 제공하지만 시간 소모가 크고 유연성이 제한적일 수 있습니다. 반면, 공진화 유전자 알고리즘은 효율적이고 유연한 지식 획득을 가능하게 하며, 복잡한 상호작용 문제를 효과적으로 해결하여 더 빠른 시간 내에 우수한 해를 찾을 수 있습니다. 두 방법 모두 장단점을 가지며, 시스템의 특성과 요구사항에 따라 적절한 방법을 선택하거나 결합하여 활용하는 것이 중요합니다.",0.6758

This system is designed to improve the hearing and visual information, and to effectively combine the two information at the final stage to achieve strong recognition rate in the noise environment. ## Main ## 1. HMM probability optimization for visual information recognition -In order to overcome the limitations of the existing EM (expected-maximum) learning algorithm, we introduced hybrid mock quenching that combines mock quenching annealing and local search operators. -Increasing the parameters of the hidden Marcov model by performing global search, the convergence speed and recognition performance were improved at the same time, and the global optimal resolution convergence characteristics of this method were mathematically proved. 2. Modeling between frames for hearing information recognition -In order to reflect the dynamic characteristics of the voice signal, the combination probability distribution between different observation frames was modeled as a Gaussian mixed model. -The new EM -based learning algorithm has been developed to effectively learn conditional dependence between frames and secure strong recognition performance in noise. 3. Integrate audiovisual information using the neuropathy network -In order to integrate the results obtained independently from visual and hearing information, we proposed a neural network -based weight learning method that can output optimal weight according to the type and level of noise. -The neuropathy network learned in this integration stage shows the same or superior recognition rate than only a single information, and maximizes the synergy effect between the two information. As a result of the speaker independent isolation word recognition experiment, it was confirmed that the integrated recognition performance was significantly improved compared to the existing system in various noise environments. ##conclusion## By combining the three strategies of the probabilistic global optimization of the hidden Marcof model, the correlation between the frame, and the neural network -based information convergence, it proved to greatly improve the recognition rate of audiovisual voice recognition even in a noise environment.","Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

In this review, we will start with a brief introduction to machine learning and deep learning and provide clinical applications of machine learning and deep learning in various aspects of stroke management, including rapid diagnosis and improved triage, identifying large vessel occlusion, predicting time from stroke onset, automated ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) measurement, lesion segmentation, and predicting treatment outcome. This work is focused on providing the current application of artificial intelligence techniques in the imaging of ischemic stroke, including MRI and CT., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002918042,","Title: An Efficient Parallel Machine Learning-based Blockchain Framework, Abstract: The unlimited possibilities of machine learning have been shown in several successful reports and applications. However, how to make sure that the searched results of a machine learning system are not tampered by anyone and how to prevent the other users in the same network environment from easily getting our private data are two critical research issues when we immerse into powerful machine learning-based systems or applications. This situation is just like other modern information systems that confront security and privacy issues. The development of blockchain provides us an alternative way to address these two issues. That is why some recent studies have attempted to develop machine learning systems with blockchain technologies or to apply machine learning methods to blockchain systems. To show what the combination of blockchain and machine learning is capable of doing, in this paper, we proposed a parallel framework to find out suitable hyperparameters of deep learning in a blockchain environment by using a metaheuristic algorithm. The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002764866,","Title: Machine learning in oncology-Perspectives in patient-reported outcome research, Abstract: AbstractBackgroundIncreasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART116697768,","Title: MACHINE LEARNING, Abstract: The motivation for machine learning is to have computers extract concepts and relations from databases or through interactive sessions with a user and then use them in any knowledge-intensive activity. Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism. We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results. We, therefore, suggest that it further expands the role of science in terrorism research., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART94298406,","Title: A Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods, Abstract: The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117389222,","Title: Liver Fibrosis Biomarker Validation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: Background: Liver fibrosis which causes several liver diseases, requires early screening and management. The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

##서론##
잡음 환경에서 음성인식 시스템의 성능 저하는 오랜 과제였으며, 이를 극복하기 위해 음성(청각) 정보와 입술 움직임(시각) 정보를 함께 활용하는 시청각 음성인식이 주목받고 있습니다. 이러한 시청각 음성인식의 인식률을 높이기 위해 은닉 마르코프 모델(HMM)과 신경망(NN)을 통합하는 다양한 전략이 연구되어 왔습니다. 이 통합 전략은 각 모델의 장점을 결합하여 잡음 환경에서의 강인한 인식 성능을 목표로 합니다.

##본론##
잡음 환경에서 시청각 음성인식의 인식률을 높이기 위한 은닉 마르코프 모델과 신경망 통합 전략은 크게 세 가지 주요 방식으로 구성됩니다.

첫째, **은닉 마르코프 모델(HMM)의 개별 모달리티 인식 및 최적화**입니다. HMM은 시계열 데이터의 확률적 모델링에 강점을 가지므로, 시각 정보(입술 움직임)와 청각 정보(음성 신호) 각각의 인식기로 활용됩니다. 시각 정보 인식에서는 HMM의 확률적 최적화 알고리즘을 통해 인식 성능을 향상시키며, 청각 정보 인식에서는 HMM이 음성의 동적 특성과 관측 프레임 간의 상관관계를 모델링하여 잡음에 강인한 성능을 얻도록 합니다.

둘째, **신경망을 이용한 정보 통합 단계**입니다. HMM을 통해 개별적으로 인식된 시각 및 청각 정보의 결과를 최종적으로 통합하는 단계에서 신경회로망이 사용됩니다. 학습된 신경회로망은 잡음의 종류나 수준을 알 수 없는 시청각 데이터에 대해 적절한 가중치를 부여하여 최적의 통합 인식 결과를 도출합니다. 이는 두 정보의 상호보완성을 효과적으로 활용하여 시너지 효과를 극대화합니다.

셋째, **HMM과 신경망의 하이브리드 모델 구성**입니다.
*   **신경망 예측 HMM**: HMM의 시간적 상관 표현력 부족이라는 단점을 보완하기 위해 신경망을 HMM의 각 상태에 대한 예측기로 정의합니다. 신경망은 과거의 특징 벡터 영향을 받아 동적으로 변화하는 예측치를 제공함으로써 HMM에 동적 특성을 부여하고 인식 성능을 개선합니다.
*   **신경망 기반 HMM 적응**: 신경망이 깨끗한 음성 HMM을 잡음 환경에 적응된 HMM으로 매핑하는 데 사용될 수 있습니다. 이는 잡음 HMM과 신호 대 잡음비(SNR)를 입력으로 받아 잡음에 강인한 HMM을 생성합니다.
*   **HMM 출력값 기반 신경망 분류**: HMM을 통해 얻어진 각 모델의 내부 출력값을 신경망 분류기의 입력으로 사용하여 추가적인 분류 작업을 수행함으로써 패턴 간의 분별력을 높입니다.
*   **이중 모드 신경망(BMNN)**: 음성과 영상 특징을 직접 통합하는 신경망 모델을 제안하여, 잡음에 의한 음성 정보 손실을 보상하고 인식률을 향상시킵니다.

Particle Swarm Optimization을 이용해 퍼지 Extreme Learning Machine의 활성화 함수 파라미터를 최적화하는 기법의 핵심 원리를 요약해 주실 수 있나요?,"##제목## PSO 기반 퍼지 Extreme Learning Machine 활성화 함수 파라미터 최적화 기법 ##서론## Extreme Learning Machine(ELM)은 전형적인 신경망 대비 학습 속도가 매우 빠르지만, 활성화 함수 파라미터를 일괄 선정할 경우 성능이 제한될 수 있다. 여기에 전문가 언어 정보 표현에 유리한 퍼지 이론을 결합한 퍼지 ELM은 활성화 함수 설계의 자유도를 높이지만, 적절한 파라미터 탐색이 필요하다. 따라서 본 기법은 Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)을 통해 퍼지 ELM의 활성화 함수 파라미터를 자동으로 최적화하고자 한다. ##본론## 먼저, 기존 시그모이드 함수 대신 퍼지 C-평균(Fuzzy C-Means) 클러스터링 알고리즘에서 도출한 활성화 레벨 함수를 사용하여 퍼지 ELM의 은닉층 출력을 정의한다. 다음으로, PSO 알고리즘을 적용하여 클러스터 중심과 퍼지 지수 등 활성화 함수의 핵심 파라미터를 탐색한다. PSO는 개체(입자)들의 군집 행동을 모방하여 전역 최적해로 빠르게 수렴하며, 반복 평가를 통해 최적의 파라미터 조합을 찾는다. 마지막으로, 다양한 머신러닝 데이터셋을 활용해 최적화 전후의 분류 성능 변화를 비교·검증한다. ##결론## PSO를 통한 활성화 함수 파라미터 자동 최적화는 퍼지 ELM의 분류 정확도와 일반화 성능을 모두 개선시키며, 반복적인 휴리스틱 설정 과정을 줄여 실용적인 모델 설계를 가능하게 한다.",없음,"##title## PSO -based fuzzy extreme learning machine activation function parameter optimization technique ##introduction## EXTREME Learning Machine (ELM) has a very fast learning speed compared to typical neural networks, but performance can be limited by selecting activation function parameters. In addition, Fuzzy ELM, which combines fuzzy theory advantageous for expert language information, increases the freedom of activation function design, but requires appropriate parameter search. Therefore, this technique intends to automatically optimize the activation function parameters of Fuzzy ELM through Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). ## Main ## First, it defines the hinting layer of the fuzzy ELM using the activation level function derived from the Fuzzy C-MeanS clustering algorithm instead of the existing sigmoid function. Next, the PSO algorithm is applied to explore the core parameters of the activation function such as the cluster center and the fuzzy index. The PSO imitates the clustering behavior of the individuals (particles) and converges quickly to the global optimal year, and finds an optimal parameter combination through repeated evaluation. Finally, it uses various machine learning datasets to compare and verify the classification performance change before and after optimization. ##conclusion## Automatic optimization of activation function parameters through PSO improves both the classification accuracy and generalization of the purge ELM, and reduces the repetitive heuristic setting process to enable practical model design.","Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives.

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). AI and ML have repeatedly shown how they revolutionise entire industries and sectors. The RecAIcle project focuses on plastic and battery characterisation and sorting. Thus, the productivity and quality of manual sorting are to be increased, and a digital assistance system that supports sorting employees in their sorting decisions is being developed for this purpose. Due to the unique requirements of such a system, the framework design was adapted accordingly. For the development of this system, advanced, life-long learning ML models are needed, which in turn require large amounts of high-quality training data and computing power.

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data. The hyperparameter optimization is performed to find the best parameters before fitting on train data, this is essential to find the best results. Multivariate analysis is performed with all the methods and errors are computed to find the best models., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002850623,","Title: Machine Learning in Predicting Hemoglobin Variants, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART93885082,","Title: Wine Quality Evaluation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: There are many prediction systems available for problems like stock exchange, medical diagnosis, insurance calculation, etc. Wine Quality is one area where there is a big opportunity to recommend a good quality of wine to users based on their preferences as well as in historical data.

Hence, the BS requests UEs to regularly feed back the CSI. However, frequent CSI reporting causes large signaling overhead. To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval. We use a deep neural network and reinforcement learning (RL) to decide whether an UE feeds back the CSI. Simulation results show that the RL-based approach achieves the lowest mean squared error while reducing the number of CSI feedback transmissions., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002921834,","Title: Big Data Analysis and Machine Learning in Intensive Care Units, Abstract: Abstract Intensive care is an ideal environment for the use of Big Data Analysis (BDA) and Machine Learning (ML), due to the huge amount of information processed and stored in electronic format in relation to such care.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field. It is time for Korean nurses to take steps to become familiar with AI in their research, education, and practice., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002572344,","Title: Machine Learning기법을 이용한 Robot 이상 예지 보전, Abstract: In this paper, a predictive maintenance of the robot trouble using the machine learning method, so called MT(Mahalanobis Taguchi), was studied.

It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches.

Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism.

Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results.

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

Particle Swarm Optimization을 이용한 퍼지 Extreme Learning Machine 활성화 함수 파라미터 최적화 기법의 핵심 원리

##서론##
Particle Swarm Optimization(PSO)을 활용하여 퍼지 Extreme Learning Machine(FELM)의 활성화 함수 파라미터를 최적화하는 기법은 FELM의 성능을 향상시키기 위한 중요한 접근 방식입니다. FELM은 기존 신경회로망의 느린 학습 속도를 개선한 Extreme Learning Machine(ELM)에 전문가의 언어적 정보를 처리할 수 있는 퍼지 이론을 접목하여, 노이즈에 강하고 빠른 학습 속도를 제공하는 네트워크입니다. 이러한 FELM의 성능은 활성화 함수의 파라미터 설정에 크게 좌우되므로, PSO를 통해 이 파라미터들을 효율적으로 찾아내는 것이 핵심입니다.

##본론##
이 기법의 핵심 원리는 PSO의 전역 탐색 능력과 FELM의 활성화 함수 파라미터 조정 필요성을 결합하는 데 있습니다.

1.  **퍼지 Extreme Learning Machine (FELM)의 특성**: FELM은 일반적인 시그모이드 함수 대신 퍼지 C-Means 클러스터링 알고리즘의 활성화 레벨 함수와 같은 비표준 활성화 함수를 사용할 수 있습니다. 이러한 활성화 함수의 파라미터들은 FELM의 학습 속도, 분류 성능, 그리고 일반화 능력에 직접적인 영향을 미칩니다. 파라미터의 적절한 설정은 네트워크의 수렴성과 정확도를 결정하는 중요한 요소가 됩니다.

2.  **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)의 작동 원리**: PSO는 새 떼의 군집 행동을 모방한 전역 최적화 알고리즘입니다. 다수의 ""입자""들이 해 공간을 탐색하며, 각 입자는 자신의 경험을 통해 찾은 최적해(개인 최적해, pbest)와 전체 군집이 찾은 최적해(전역 최적해, gbest)를 기반으로 자신의 위치와 속도를 업데이트합니다. 이러한 방식으로 PSO는 복잡한 목적 함수에 대한 최적해를 효율적으로 찾아낼 수 있으며, 특히 기울기 정보가 필요 없는 장점이 있어 다양한 최적화 문제에 적용됩니다.

3.  **활성화 함수 파라미터 최적화 과정**: PSO를 FELM의 활성화 함수 파라미터 최적화에 적용하는 과정은 다음과 같습니다.
    *   **파라미터 공간 정의**: FELM 활성화 함수의 파라미터(예: 퍼지 C-Means 클러스터링 기반 활성화 함수의 파라미터)를 PSO가 탐색할 해 공간으로 정의합니다.
    *   **입자 초기화**: 여러 입자(잠재적 파라미터 조합)를 이 해 공간에 무작위로 초기 배치합니다.
    *   **적합도 평가**: 각 입자가 나타내는 파라미터 조합을 사용하여 FELM 모델을 구성하고, 특정 데이터셋에 대한 분류 성능(예: 정확도, 오차율)을 측정하여 해당 파라미터 조합의 '적합도'를 평가합니다.
    *   **최적해 업데이트**: 각 입자는 자신의 현재 적합도와 과거 최고 적합도를 비교하여 개인 최적해(pbest)를 업데이트하고, 전체 군집 내에서 가장 높은 적합도를 가진 입자의 위치를 전역 최적해(gbest)로 설정합니다.
    *   **위치 및 속도 업데이트**: 각 입자는 자신의 pbest와 gbest에 이끌려 새로운 위치와 속도로 이동하며 파라미터 공간을 탐색합니다. 이 과정은 반복적으로 수행되어 점차 더 나은 활성화 함수 파라미터 조합을 찾아냅니다.

이러한 과정을 통해 PSO는 FELM의 활성화 함수 파라미터들을 자동으로 조정하여, 수동 튜닝의 한계를 극복하고 모델의 학습 성능과 일반화 능력을 효과적으로 개선합니다.

##결론##
PSO를 이용한 FELM 활성화 함수 파라미터 최적화 기법의 핵심 원리는 PSO의 집단 지능 기반 전역 탐색 능력을 활용하여 FELM의 활성화 함수 파라미터 공간에서 최적의 조합을 찾아내는 것입니다. 이는 FELM의 학습 속도 개선 및 노이즈 강건성이라는 장점을 극대화하고, 모델의 분류 성능과 수렴성을 향상시키는 데 기여합니다. PSO는 복잡한 비선형 최적화 문제에 효과적인 솔루션을 제공함으로써, FELM의 실용적인 적용 가능성을 높이는 중요한 역할을 합니다.",0.6758
Lifelong Machine Learning 앙상블 방식으로 스팸 메시지 필터링 성능을 개선한 방법의 주요 아이디어와 장점을 간결하게 제시해 주실 수 있나요?,"##제목## Lifelong Machine Learning과 나이브 베이즈 앙상블을 이용한 스팸 메시지 필터링 ##서론## 스팸 문자는 끊임없이 새로운 단어와 패턴을 적용해 기존 필터를 우회하므로, 고정된 학습 모델만으로는 적절히 대응하기 어렵다. 이러한 한계를 극복하기 위해 과거 지식을 누적·활용하며 지속 학습하는 Lifelong Machine Learning(LLML) 개념이 도입되었다. ##본론## 제안 기법은 문서 분류에 널리 사용되는 나이브 베이즈 분류기와 LLML의 ELLA 모델을 앙상블로 결합한다. LLML은 이전 학습에서 획득한 특성·패턴 정보를 새로운 데이터에 전이해 빠르게 적응하고, 나이브 베이즈는 낮은 계산 복잡도로 실시간 필터링에 적합하다. 앙상블 구조를 통해 두 모델의 장점을 동시에 활용함으로써, 신규 스팸 단어·패턴에도 높은 민감도와 정확도를 유지할 수 있다. ##결론## 과거 학습 경험을 지속적으로 보존·활용하는 LLML 기반 앙상블은 스팸 필터링의 적응성을 대폭 향상시키며, 변화하는 스팸 유형에 효과적으로 대응할 수 있다.","Lifelong Machine Learning ensemble, can you provide a concise of the main ideas and advantages of the method that improves spam message filtering performance?","##title## Lifelong Machine Learning and Spam Message Filtering using Nive Bayes Ensemble ##introduction## Spam characters are constantly bypassing existing filters by applying new words and patterns, so it is difficult to respond properly with a fixed learning model alone. In order to overcome these limitations, the concept of LIFELONG MACHINE Learning (LLML), which cumulates and utilizes past knowledge, has been introduced. ## Main ## The proposal technique combines the Nive Bayes classifier and the ELLA model of LLML, which are widely used in document classification, with ensemble. LLML is quickly adapted to the new data by transferring the characteristics and pattern information obtained from previous learning, and Nive Bayes is suitable for real -time filtering with low computation complexity. By using the advantages of the two models at the same time through the ensemble structure, it is possible to maintain high sensitivity and accuracy in new spam words and patterns. ##conclusion## LLML -based ensemble, which continuously preserves and utilizes past learning experiences, greatly improves the adaptability of spam filtering and can effectively respond to changing spam types.","Title: u-IT Convergence 기기의 성능평가기준과 표준화 연구, Abstract: u-IT 기술의 발달로 인해 통신, 방송, 포털, 콘텐츠, 장비 및 솔루션 등 사업의 모든 분야에 u-IT Convergence 기기들이 연구 개발되고 있다. 본 논문에서는 u-IT Convergence를 정의하고, u-IT Convergence 기기들과 단말에서 정보를 감지하는 온도, 압력, 자기, 광, 가스, 습도 센서들에 대한 정의와 평가 기준으로 기술성, 경제성, 경영성 등의 평가 기준을 제시한다. 또한 u-IT Convergence 기기들에 대한 평가 기준에 따르는 u-IT Convergence 네트워크 기기의 표준화 기준을 연구하였다. 본 연구를 통해 유비쿼터스 정보화 사회에서 기술적인 발전과 기기들에 대한 정확한 인증 평가를 통해서 안정성과 신뢰성을 갖춘 평가 제품으로서 가치를 정립하고 표준화를 이루는데 기여하게 될 것이다., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP12915394,","Title: IT 기반의 convergence 제품의 구입태도에 대한 연구, Abstract: 본 연구의 목적은 소비자들이 IT 기반의 컨버전스 제품을 구매함에 있어서 지각하는 구매태도를 바탕으로 구매의사결정을 이론적 배경에 대한 검토를 바탕으로 가설을 설정하고 이들 가설을 검증하기 위하여 실증연구를 수행하였다.

This method enables effective design without initial design, but has been limited in use due to high computational costs. At the same time, machine learning (ML) methodology including deep learning has made great progress in the 21st century, and accordingly, many studies have been conducted to enable effective and rapid optimization by applying ML to TO. Therefore, this study reviews and analyzes previous research on ML-based TO (MLTO). Two different perspectives of MLTO are used to review studies: (i) TO and (ii) ML perspectives. The TO perspective addresses “why” to use ML for TO, while the ML perspective addresses “how” to apply ML to TO.

Despite advances and optimisations in automatic sensor-based sorting, hand sorting of waste remains relevant. The recAIcle project aims to advance the digitalisation of hand sorting in waste management using Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML) and Human-Machine Interaction (HMI).

Present generation ships are semi-autonomous and controlled by the ship crew. The performance of the ship is predicted using the data collected from the ship with the help of machine learning and deep learning methods. Path planning for an autonomous ship is necessary for estimating the best possible route with minimum travel time and it depends on the weather. However, even during the navigation, there will be changes in weather and it should be predicted in order to reroute the ship. The weather information such as wave height, wave period, seawater temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, etc., is collected by ship external sensors, weather stations, buoys, and satellites. This paper investigates the ensemble machine learning approaches and seasonality approach for wave data prediction. The historical meteorological data are collected from six stations near Puerto Rico offshore and Hawaii offshore. We explore ensemble machine learning techniques on the data collected. The collected data are divided into training and testing data and apply machine learning models to predict the test data.

To reduce the feedback overhead, we propose two machine learning-based approaches to adjust the CSI feedback interval.

The present study reviews the following topics: the concepts of AI, machine learning, and deep learning; examples of AI-based nursing research; the necessity of education on AI in nursing schools; and the areas of nursing care where AI is useful. AI refers to an intelligent system consisting not of a human, but a machine. Machine learning refers to computers’ ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks consisting of multiple hidden layers. It is suggested that the educational curriculum should include big data, the concept of AI, algorithms and models of machine learning, the model of deep learning, and coding practice. The standard curriculum should be organized by the nursing society. An example of an area of nursing care where AI is useful is prenatal nursing interventions based on pregnant women’s nursing records and AI-based prediction of the risk of delivery according to pregnant women’s age. Nurses should be able to cope with the rapidly developing environment of nursing care influenced by AI and should understand how to apply AI in their field.

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758,","Title: Machine Learning Versus Deep Learning Performances on the Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews, Abstract: At this current digital era, business platforms have been drastically shifted toward online stores on internet. With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques. On comparing performance of machine learning against deep learning models, we compare results from the two methods with both the preprocessed dataset and the non-preprocessed dataset. The result is that the bag of words with neural network outperforms other techniques on both non-preprocess and preprocess datasets., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114024871,","Title: Analysis of Machine Learning Education Tool for Kids, Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are used in many parts of our daily lives, but the basic processes and concepts are barely exposed to most people.

The proposed framework also takes into account the issue of communication cost, by limiting the number of information exchanges between miners and blockchain., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002764866,","Title: Machine learning in oncology-Perspectives in patient-reported outcome research, Abstract: AbstractBackgroundIncreasing data volumes in oncology pose new challenges for data analysis. Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, can identify patterns even in very large and less structured datasets.ObjectiveThis article provides an overview of the possible applications for machine learning in oncology. Furthermore, the potential of machine learning in patient-reported outcome (PRO) research is discussed.Materials and methodsWe conducted a selective literature search (PubMed, MEDLINE, IEEE Xplore) and discuss current research.ResultsThere are three primary applications for machine learning in oncology: (1) cancer detection or classification; (2) overall survival prediction or risk assessment; and (3) supporting therapy decision-making and prediction of treatment response. Generally, machine learning approaches in oncology PRO research are scarce and few studies integrate PRO data into machine learning models.DiscussionMachine learning is a promising area of oncology, but few models have been transferred into clinical practice. The promise of personalized cancer therapy and shared decision-making through machine learning has yet to be realized. As an equally important emerging research area in oncology, PROs should also be incorporated into machine learning approaches. To gather the data necessary for this, broad implementation of PRO assessments in clinical practice, as well as the harmonization of existing datasets, is suggested., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART116697768,","Title: MACHINE LEARNING, Abstract: The motivation for machine learning is to have computers extract concepts and relations from databases or through interactive sessions with a user and then use them in any knowledge-intensive activity. Developing knowledge bases for expert systems applications is one such activity. Studying computer-based learning techniques gives a better understanding of human mental processes. Two types of programs are considered that learn from examples: those, called data-driven learners, that generalize by relying entirely on the data presented to them, and a group of more elaborate programs, called model-driven learners, that proceed by generating fairly general hypotheses that are subsequently tested against the given examples or against the user in a typical interactive session. The model-driven learner is contrasted with the data-driven learner and an example of the former using a model-driven learner called Marvin is given., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART17972174,","Title: Machine Learning을 이용한 자동 돌발상황검지, Abstract: Incidents on the freeway disrupt traffic flow and the cost of delay caused by incidents is significant. To reduce the impact of an incident, a traffic management center needs to quickly detect and remove it from the freeway. Quick and efficient automatic incident detection has been a main goal of the transportation research for many years. Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID). However, many of them have a limited success in their overall performance in terms of detection rate, false alarm rate, and the mean time to detect an incident. Until recently, the neural network models have been the one of the popular and efficient approach for real-time automatic incident detection and many researches have shown that the neural network models were much more efficient than various other previous models. The purpose of this research is to propose a more efficient and accurate model than the neural network model in the automatic incident detection problem. For this purpose, a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning which is based on the statistical learning theory, has been used in this paper. The experiments have been done with real world freeway data, and the results show that the SVM could provide better performance in terms of DR(Detection Rate) and FAR(False Alarm Rate) than Backpropagation which is the most popular neural network model., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001157316,","Title: Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning, Abstract: 없음, Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122202269,","Title: Predicting Terrorism with Machine Learning: Lessons from “Predicting Terrorism: A Machine Learning Approach”, Abstract: AbstractThis paper highlights how machine learning can help explain terrorism. We note that even though machine learning has a reputation for black box prediction, in fact, it can provide deeply nuanced explanations of terrorism. Moreover, machine learning is not sensitive to the sometimes heroic statistical assumptions necessary when parametric econometrics is applied to the study of terrorism. This increases the reliability of explanations while adding contextual nuance that captures the flavor of individualized case analysis. Nevertheless, this approach also gives us a sense of the replicability of results. We, therefore, suggest that it further expands the role of science in terrorism research., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART94298406,","Title: A Survey of Topological Machine Learning Methods, Abstract: The last decade saw an enormous boost in the field of computational topology: methods and concepts from algebraic and differential topology, formerly confined to the realm of pure mathematics, have demonstrated their utility in numerous areas such as computational biology personalised medicine, and time-dependent data analysis, to name a few. The newly-emerging domain comprising topology-based techniques is often referred to as topological data analysis (TDA). Next to their applications in the aforementioned areas, TDA methods have also proven to be effective in supporting, enhancing, and augmenting both classical machine learning and deep learning models. In this paper, we review the state of the art of a nascent field we refer to as &ldquo;topological machine learning,&rdquo; i.e., the successful symbiosis of topology-based methods and machine learning algorithms, such as deep neural networks. We identify common threads, current applications, and future challenges., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART117389222,","Title: Liver Fibrosis Biomarker Validation Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Abstract: Background: Liver fibrosis which causes several liver diseases, requires early screening and management. The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis. Conclusively, machine learning models showed better performance than noninvasive scores., Source: http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002974610,","Title: Effective E-Learning Practices by Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Abstract: This is an extended research paper focusing on the applications of Machine Learing and Artificial Intelligence in virtual learning environment.

Lifelong Machine Learning 앙상블 기반 스팸 메시지 필터링의 주요 아이디어 및 장점

##서론##
스팸 메시지는 끊임없이 변화하는 단어와 패턴을 사용하여 기존 기계 학습 시스템의 필터링 한계를 야기합니다. 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 Lifelong Machine Learning(LLML) 앙상블 방식이 스팸 메시지 필터링 성능 개선을 위한 효과적인 대안으로 제시되었습니다.

##본론##
**주요 아이디어:**
Lifelong Machine Learning 앙상블 방식의 핵심 아이디어는 문서 분류에 널리 사용되는 나이브 베이즈(Naive Bayes)와 같은 기존 기계 학습 모델에 Lifelong Machine Learning(LLML)의 앙상블 기법을 결합하는 것입니다. 특히 ELLA(Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm)와 같은 LLML 모델을 적용하여, 시스템이 기존에 학습한 지식을 활용하면서 새로운 지식을 지속적으로 학습하고 적응하도록 합니다. 이는 스팸 발송자들이 필터링을 회피하기 위해 사용하는 새로운 단어나 패턴의 변화에 효과적으로 대응하기 위함입니다.

**장점:**
이 방식의 주요 장점은 다음과 같습니다.
1.  **지속적인 학습 및 적응 능력:** 기존 기계 학습이 새로운 스팸 단어나 패턴을 감지하고 적응하는 데 한계가 있는 반면, LLML 앙상블은 기존 지식을 바탕으로 새로운 지식을 끊임없이 학습하여 스팸의 변화에 능동적으로 대응할 수 있습니다.
2.  **성능 개선:** 여러 분류기의 조합을 통해 단일 모델보다 더 우수한 분류 성능을 제공하며, 특히 스팸 필터링의 정확도와 재현율을 향상시킬 수 있습니다.
3.  **기존 시스템의 한계 극복:** 스팸 패턴의 지속적인 변화로 인해 기존 스팸 필터링 시스템이 걸러내지 못하는 새로운 유형의 스팸 메시지를 효과적으로 탐지하고 차단할 수 있습니다.

##결론##
Lifelong Machine Learning 앙상블 방식은 기존 기계 학습의 한계를 극복하고, 끊임없이 진화하는 스팸 메시지에 대한 필터링 성능을 지속적으로 개선할 수 있는 강력한 방법을 제공합니다. 기존 지식의 활용과 새로운 지식의 지속적인 학습을 통해 스팸 탐지 정확도를 높이고, 사용자에게 더욱 안전하고 효율적인 메시지 환경을 제공하는 데 기여합니다.",0.6758
