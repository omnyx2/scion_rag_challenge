To manage the complexity of coordinating interventions across the entire food network, the Sustainable Development Solutions Network has recommended a generic enabling framework. This framework is designed to be a universally applicable platform for all countries, regardless of their development status.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe proposed enabling framework for SDG2 functions as a platform to connect the wide array of individuals, stakeholders, and agencies involved in the food chain. Its primary purpose is to manage the feedbacks and information flows necessary for the effective execution of interventions aimed at achieving food security and sustainability.\n\nThe success of this framework is critically dependent on two key elements: data sharing and near real-time analytics. According to the provided context, a \"clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data.\" This free exchange of information is the foundation upon which the system operates.\n\nComplementing data sharing is the application of \"near real-time analytics on that data.\" This process is essential for transforming raw data into the \"necessary knowledge flows\" that guide decision-making and interventions within the framework. The implementation of this data-driven approach involves deploying existing and new technologies, including sensors, networking technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and Big Data-related technologies, to facilitate data-driven innovation in both developing and western economies.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, the proposed enabling framework for achieving SDG2 is a collaborative platform designed to connect all stakeholders within the global food network. Its effectiveness hinges on the foundational principles of open data sharing and the application of near real-time analytics. By leveraging these data-driven innovations, the framework aims to create the essential knowledge flows needed to coordinate complex actions and successfully address the global challenges of hunger and sustainable food production.",
