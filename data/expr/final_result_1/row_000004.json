SAI refers to the use of artificial intelligence in a manner that supports sustainable development, such as reducing pollution and waste, while also mitigating associated risks like increased societal inequality or high resource consumption. According to the provided context, a sustainability-oriented corporate culture is a crucial indicator and influencing factor in whether a company can successfully realize SAI.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe provided documents highlight that a specific type of corporate culture is essential for guiding the use of AI towards sustainable goals. A paper titled \"Sustainable artificial intelligence: A corporate culture perspective\" directly explores how corporate culture influences the application of AI for sustainable development.\n\nBased on a bibliometric literature analysis, this paper identifies distinct features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. It further offers six propositions that examine how these specific cultural characteristics affect the \"handling of AI in the sense of SAI,\" which encompasses both its development and management. While the provided text confirms that these features and propositions have been identified, it does not specify what they are. The core finding is that the corporate environment is a primary determinant in ensuring that AI is developed and managed in a truly sustainable way.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, a sustainability-oriented corporate culture is a foundational element for the successful development and management of sustainable artificial intelligence. It acts as both an important indicator and a direct influencing factor. For companies aiming to leverage AI for sustainable development while managing its risks, fostering the appropriate corporate culture is an indispensable step.",

For example, AI solutions can help reduce pollution, waste, or carbon footprints. On the other hand, there are also risks associated with the use of AI, such as increasing inequality in society or high resource consumption for computing power. This paper explores the question how corporate culture influences the use of artificial intelligence in terms of sustainable development. This type of use includes a normative element and is referred to in the paper as sustainable artificial intelligence (SAI). Based on a bibliometric literature analysis, we identify features of a sustainability-oriented corporate culture. We offer six propositions examining the influence of specific manifestations on the handling of AI in the sense of SAI. Thus, if companies want to ensure that SAI is realized, corporate culture appears as an important indicator and influencing factor at the same time."

What are the limits? What doesn't work as advertised? What isn't likely to work? What isn't affordable? This article holds a mirror up to the community, both to provide feedback and stimulate more self-assessment. The significant accomplishments and strengths of the field are highlighted. The research agenda, strategy, and heuristics are reviewed, and a change of course is recommended to improve the field's ability to produce reusable and interoperable components.(Author abstract)"
