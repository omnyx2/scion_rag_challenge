        "title": "Principal Concerns and Proposed Solutions for IT Companies in Defense IT Convergence",
        "introduction": "IT convergence technology is crucial for advancing weapon systems and ensuring efficient operations within military reforms in Korea. A study investigating IT firms' perspectives on the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems identified key concerns and implicitly suggested solutions.",
        "main_body": "IT companies involved in defense-related IT convergence face three principal concerns. First, there is a need for clarification regarding the role of IT firms in defense IT-convergent efforts. Second, the establishment of a control tower for defense IT convergence is a significant issue. Third, a reasonable estimation of software development cost within the defense acquisition process is a major concern.\n\nRegarding proposed solutions, for cost estimation, the primary solution is to achieve a reasonable estimation of software development cost in the defense acquisition process. For governance, the proposed solution is the establishment of a control tower specifically for defense IT convergence.",
        "conclusion": "Addressing these concerns, particularly by clarifying roles, establishing a dedicated control tower, and ensuring accurate software development cost estimation, is essential for the successful integration of IT in defense systems and for fostering effective participation from IT companies."
