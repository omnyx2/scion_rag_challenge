This system is based on TurKontrol, a theoretical model that uses Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) to optimize iterative, crowd-sourced workflows. The system is designed to learn the TurKontrol model's parameters directly from real Mechanical Turk data, overcoming challenges such as the large scale of the model and noisy data from workers with highly variable abilities.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe approach of this end-to-end system involves two primary stages. First, it learns the POMDP parameters by analyzing real data from Mechanical Turk. A key part of this learning process is the modeling of worker accuracy and their voting patterns. Once the model parameters are learned, the system applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. This allows it to control a successive-improvement process on the platform, adapting to the performance of the crowd workers in real-time.\n\nThe results of implementing this system are significant. After validating the model, it was found to produce \"significantly superior artifacts\" compared to those generated by nonadaptive workflows. This improvement in quality was achieved while using the same amount of money, demonstrating the system's efficiency and effectiveness in optimizing crowdsourced tasks.\n\n##Conclusion##\nThe system successfully learns and applies the TurKontrol POMDP model to enhance iterative crowdsourcing. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns from real-world data, it dynamically optimizes tasks to produce superior results. This approach proves to be a more effective and cost-efficient method for quality control compared to nonadaptive workflows on platforms like Mechanical Turk.",
