While the query focuses on the integration of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and neural networks for robust audiovisual speech recognition in noisy environments, the available documents primarily detail the structure and function of neural networks. The texts do not contain information regarding Hidden Markov Models, their integration with neural networks, or specific strategies for achieving robustness in noisy settings.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe provided information describes Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) as a theoretical framework for artificial intelligence. An ANN is structured with input, hidden, and output vectors, which are interconnected by weight matrices. The process of mapping from input to output is achieved through simple matrix multiplication.\n\nIn the context of speech recognition and machine translation, neural networks are a key technology. Neural machine translation is identified as the primary algorithm used in the industry. The architecture for this involves two recurrent neural networks working together to form an encoder-decoder structure. This approach is part of a broader effort to develop systems that can recognize human speech and convert audio input into text, as well as translate between languages like English and Hindi. Deep learning, which utilizes neural networks with a large number of layers, has been successfully applied to audio and text modeling.\n\nHowever, the provided documents do not mention Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Consequently, there is no information on how HMMs and neural networks are integrated in an audiovisual speech recognition approach. Furthermore, the texts do not discuss the specific challenge of operating in noisy environments or how this integrated system would achieve robustness.\n\n##Conclusion##\nBased on the provided JSON data, the context explains the fundamental structure of Artificial Neural Networks and their application in speech recognition through an encoder-decoder architecture using recurrent neural networks. However, the documents do not contain any information about Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), the method of integrating them with neural networks, or how such a system enhances robustness for audiovisual speech recognition in noisy environments. Therefore, the specific question cannot be answered from the given context.",
