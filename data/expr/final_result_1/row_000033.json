Driven by improvements in ICT and power system technology, this convergence blurs the traditional boundaries between IT and OT. An ADMS is designed to incorporate new concepts like interoperability to enhance the operational efficiency of power distribution systems by leveraging global information and functions from various interconnected systems.\n\n##Main Body##\nBased on the provided context, the key design elements and convergence concepts of an IT/OT-based ADMS can be distilled as follows:\n\n**Convergence Concepts:**\n*   **IT/OT Convergence:** The foundational concept is the integration of Information Technology (IT) with Operation Technology (OT), also referred to as IT/automation convergence. This involves employing both IT and OT together within the ADMS.\n*   **Blurred Technical Boundaries:** The convergence leads to the blurring of technical distinctions between IT and OT, fostering a more unified operational environment.\n*   **Interoperability:** New concepts such as interoperability are central to this convergence, allowing different systems and applications to work together seamlessly.\n*   **Enhanced Efficiency:** The primary goal of this convergence is to increase the operational efficiency of the distribution system by utilizing comprehensive information and functionalities from other systems.\n\n**Key Design Elements:**\n*   **Foundation in Previous Systems:** The ADMS design builds upon the functionalities of earlier systems. It evolves from Distribution SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) for remote monitoring and control, and Distribution Automation Systems that provide basic functions like service restoration.\n*   **Application-Driven Operation:** A core design principle is the operation of the ADMS through various applications specifically created to enhance the performance of the distribution system.\n*   **Integrated Configurations and Functions:** The design of an IT/OT convergence-based ADMS is characterized by its specific configurations and functions that facilitate the unified operation of both IT and OT components. This integrated approach is essential for implementing the advanced capabilities of the system.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, the Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) represents a significant technological advancement rooted in the concept of IT/OT convergence. This convergence blurs the lines between information and operational technologies, promoting interoperability and leveraging advancements in ICT. The design of an ADMS is fundamentally based on this integrated approach, incorporating specific configurations and functions that build upon existing automation systems to create a more efficient, application-driven platform for managing power distribution.",
