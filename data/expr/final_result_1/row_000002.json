Based on the provided context, this document will explain the mathematical principles of ANNs and how they are introduced to the field of applied linguistics, specifically focusing on how inputs and outputs are related.\n\n##Main Body##\nAccording to the provided information, an Artificial Neural Network is structured with input, hidden, and output vectors. The relationship and connection between these vectors are established through weight matrices.\n\nThe process of transforming an input into an output, referred to as mapping, is accomplished through a specific mathematical operation. The provided text states that the \"mapping from input to output is accounted for by simple matrix multiplication.\" This indicates that the network employs weight matrices to connect the vectors, and the actual calculation that relates the input to the final output is performed via matrix multiplication.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn the context of applied linguistics, artificial neural networks utilize a structure of input, hidden, and output vectors. These vectors are interconnected by weight matrices, and the mapping from input to output is fundamentally achieved through the process of simple matrix multiplication.",

This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition."

Logical languages are widely used for expressing the declarative knowledge needed in artificial intelligence systems. Symbolic logic also provides a clear semantics for knowledge representation languages and a methodology for analyzing and comparing deductive inference techniques. Several observations gained from experience with the approach are discussed. Finally, we confront some challenging problems for artificial intelligence and describe what is being done in an attempt to solve them."
