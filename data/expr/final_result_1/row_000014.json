While these two approaches may seem contradictory—one being data-driven and the other model-driven—the text posits that in practice, no model is purely one or the other. It proposes that Big Data analytics can serve as the crucial bridge, successfully integrating these methods to create robust and effective personalized medical solutions.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe core idea presented is the combination of \"purely phenomenological knowledge,\" which is extracted by analyzing vast amounts of data, with the \"detailed mechanistic models\" sought by researchers for individual patients. Big Data analytics is identified as the key enabler for this synthesis, allowing for the creation of effective \"in silico medicine solutions.\" This integration is not without its challenges, and the content specifies that big data technologies must evolve to meet the unique requirements of this medical application.\n\nThese domain-specific requirements include:\n*   **Handling Sensitive Data:** Ensuring privacy and security when working with patient information.\n*   **Complex Data Analytics:** Developing methods to analyze heterogeneous data spaces that include non-textual information.\n*   **Distributed Data Management:** Managing data across different locations while maintaining high security and performance.\n*   **Multi-Scale Integration:** Using specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at the tissue, organ, and organism levels.\n*   **Defining Physiological State:** Employing specialized analytics to define the unique \"physiological envelope\" of each patient during their daily life.\n\nBy addressing these needs, Big Data and data science can provide a richer understanding of patient phenomena, which in turn allows for the tailoring of interventional strategies that are truly personalized to the individual.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, the content describes a powerful combination where Big Data analytics facilitates the integration of phenomenological (data-driven) and mechanistic (model-based) approaches. This synergy is presented as the future of personalized healthcare, leading to the development of robust in silico medicine. However, realizing this potential requires targeted research and funding to advance big data technologies, making them capable of handling the complexity, sensitivity, and scale of data in modern medicine.",

This big data is placing data learning as a central scientific discipline. It includes collection, storage, preprocessing, visualization and, essentially, statistical analysis of enormous batches of data. In this paper, we discuss the role of statistics regarding some of the issues raised by big data in this new paradigm and also propose the name of data learning to describe all the activities that allow to obtain relevant knowledge from this new source of information."

But in practice no model is ever entirely phenomenological or entirely mechanistic. We propose in this position paper that big data analytics can be successfully combined with VPH technologies to produce robust and effective in silico medicine solutions. In order to do this, big data technologies must be further developed to cope with some specific requirements that emerge from this application. Such requirements are: working with sensitive data; analytics of complex and heterogeneous data spaces, including nontextual information; distributed data management under security and performance constraints; specialized analytics to integrate bioinformatics and systems biology information with clinical observations at tissue, organ and organisms scales; and specialized analytics to define the &#x201C;physiological envelope&#x201D; during the daily life of each patient. These domain-specific requirements suggest a need for targeted funding, in which big data technologies for in silico medicine becomes the research priority."

Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient."

Thus, analysis has continued for a long time in the quantity and quality of data, and there are changes in the location of data in the social sciences, past trends and the emergence of big data. The introduction of big data is presented as a prototype of new social science and is a useful practical example that empirically shows the need, basis, and direction of analysis through trend prediction services. Big data provides a future perspective as an important foundation for social change within the framework of basic social sciences."
