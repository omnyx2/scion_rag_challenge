        "title": "Summary of Deep Learning Research Trends and Country-Specific Differences from Topic Modeling Analysis",
        "introduction": "The provided context describes a study that systematically analyzed deep learning research trends over the past ten years using text mining and LDA based topic modeling analysis. The study aimed to identify trends by topic and differences among major research countries.",
        "main_body": "A study was conducted to analyze deep learning research trends over the past decade. This analysis involved collecting research literature on deep learning and performing an LDA based topic modeling analysis. The study specifically aimed to analyze trends by topic over the ten-year period. Furthermore, it sought to identify differences among major research countries, including China, the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. While the context indicates that such an analysis was performed and that differences were identified, the specific main findings from the topic modeling analysis regarding the detailed trends by topic over the ten years are not provided. Similarly, the specific country-specific differences observed across all mentioned countries are not detailed, beyond a separate document mentioning China's deep learning development in applications like computer vision, voice recognition, and natural language processing.",
        "conclusion": "In conclusion, a systematic analysis using LDA based topic modeling was performed to understand deep learning research trends over the last ten years and to identify country-specific differences among China, the United States, South Korea, and the United Kingdom. The context confirms the execution of this analysis and the identification of such differences, but it does not elaborate on the specific main findings of the topic trends or the detailed country-specific distinctions."
