        "Title": "Key Findings of Socio-Technical Evaluation on Big Data Developmental Processes and User Adoption Factors",
        "Introduction": "A socio-technical evaluation was conducted to understand the developmental processes of Big Data and the factors influencing user adoption. This evaluation aimed to demystify Big Data ecology, its perception by stakeholders, potential value, challenges, and implications for various organizations and policymakers.",
        "Main Body": "The socio-technical evaluation on the Big Data phenomenon revealed insights into the developmental processes through which new practices of thinking and enacting are implemented, embedded, and integrated, specifically in South Korea. Regarding user adoption, empirical analyses of user modeling identified cognitive motivations and user values as the primary determining factors influencing users' adoption of Big Data. Based on these findings, the study concluded that Big Data development should be guided by user-centered ideas, emphasizing that users ought to be the central focus of Big Data design.",
        "Conclusion": "In summary, the socio-technical evaluation highlighted the importance of understanding the integration of new Big Data practices and identified cognitive motivations and user values as crucial for user adoption. The overarching recommendation is to prioritize user-centered design in Big Data development."
