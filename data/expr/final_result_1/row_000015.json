The study utilized Normalization Process Theory to assess how new practices are implemented and integrated, alongside empirical analyses to model user adoption.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe evaluation focused on the developmental processes through which new ways of thinking about and enacting Big Data are implemented, embedded, and integrated. The study also explored the factors that influence users' adoption of Big Data, identifying cognitive motivations and user values as the primary determining factors in this process. The research sought to understand the Big Data ecology, its perception by various stakeholders, its potential value, and its challenges for both private and public organizations.\n\n##Conclusion##\nBased on its qualitative and quantitative findings, the study concludes that the key to successful Big Data implementation is a user-centered approach. The primary finding is that Big Data should be developed with user-centered ideas, and users should be the main focus of Big Data design.",
