It serves as a crucial bridge between database systems and commercial applications, primarily fueled by the availability of \"Big Data.\" The scale of data, as seen in \"tera-scale learning\" and \"very large neural networks,\" is identified as a significant factor in creating high-quality models. This evolution necessitates a cross-fertilization of research between the database and machine learning communities to improve systems and support.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe main points regarding the role of large-scale machine learning in connecting database systems and commercial applications can be outlined as follows:\n\n*   **Foundation in Big Data:** Large and high-quality data, often referred to as \"Big Data,\" is the fundamental enabler for successful machine learning algorithms and models. Database systems provide the repository for this data, which forms the basis for training and operationalizing machine learning.\n*   **Driving Commercial Applications:** Machine learning is a key driver of modern commerce. Its applications are far-reaching, providing functionalities such as building expert systems, solving classification problems, and implementing learning control methods. These capabilities translate directly into advanced commercial and scientific tools.\n*   **Fostering a Symbiotic Relationship:** There is a recognized need to \"cross-fertilize research between the database and machine learning communities.\" This involves understanding the computational models and workflows behind large-scale machine learning to develop better systems support. The goal is to close critical gaps in the current state-of-the-art, ensuring that database systems can effectively support the demands of advanced machine learning.\n*   **Addressing Operational Challenges:** While powerful, the operationalization of machine learning models presents significant challenges for companies. Unlike established processes in data mining, there is no standard for the machine learning life cycle. This creates implications for data management, requiring a holistic view that encompasses the nature of the data, the roles within machine learning teams, and the entire lifecycle of the models.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn conclusion, large-scale machine learning acts as a vital intermediary that transforms vast quantities of data from database systems into valuable, functional commercial applications. It leverages \"Big Data\" to build powerful models for tasks like classification and control, thereby driving modern commerce. The effective integration of these fields depends on continued research to provide better systems support and to overcome the operational challenges in deploying machine learning models, ultimately fostering a stronger, more collaborative relationship between the database and machine learning communities.",

Even more so, recent results such as those on tera-scale learning [1] and on very large neural networks [2] suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial introduces current applications, techniques and systems with the aim of cross-fertilizing research between the database and machine learning communities. The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning, their computational model and the workflow behind building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state-of-the-art in systems support in the bulk of the tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state-of-the-art. This leads to the closing of the seminar, where we introduce two sets of open research questions: Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and support for recent advances in Machine Learning research."

Big Data is an enabler, as large and high-quality data are always the basis for successful machine learning algorithms and models. There is currently no fully established standard process for the machine learning life cycle, as is the case in data mining with the CRISP-DM-Process, which means that the operationalization of machine learning models in particular can present companies with major challenges. In this article, the implications for data management in companies are worked out on the basis of the view of the nature of the data, the various roles in machine learning teams and the life cycle of machine learning models."
