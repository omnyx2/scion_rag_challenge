This is particularly true for neurosciences based on medical images. However, alongside these opportunities, there are significant challenges related to data quality, ethics, and the inherent difficulties of applying data science in a healthcare context.\n\n##Main Body##\n**Advances in Application**\n\nThe application of AI, particularly deep learning (DL), has demonstrated remarkable progress and feasibility in medical imaging for neurology. Key advances include:\n\n*   **Enhanced Image Recognition:** AI has shown significant progress in image recognition tasks, which is fundamental to analyzing neuroimaging data.\n*   **Improved Clinical Practice:** Various aspects of clinical neuroimaging can be improved with AI. Specific applications include:\n    *   Detecting brain metastases.\n    *   Predicting the treatment response of brain tumors.\n    *   Generating parametric maps from dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI.\n    *   Enhancing radiomics research by extracting key features from images.\n*   **Better Image Quality:** AI can be used to improve the quality of medical images through techniques like AI-based image reconstruction and the reduction of motion artifacts.\n*   **Utilization of Big Data:** The ability to analyze large volumes of information, including Real-World Data (RWD), is a major advancement, allowing for more comprehensive insights.\n\n**Challenges in Application**\n\nDespite the progress, the field faces several challenges that need to be addressed for successful implementation:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Ethics:** Ensuring the high quality of large datasets and navigating the ethical considerations are primary challenges.\n*   **Intrinsic Difficulties:** There are inherent difficulties in applying data science principles and techniques within the complex environment of healthcare.\n*   **Practical Limitations:** Broader questions about the practical application of AI remain, including understanding what truly works, the limits of the technology, affordability, and the need to develop reusable and interoperable components.",
