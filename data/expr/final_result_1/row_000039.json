Korea government established IT convergence policy in 2008 and has been implementing it to the core industry such as automotive, shipbuilding and defense industries. This research analyzes various IT convergence issues based on an operation of defense IT convergence center, one of the industry IT convergence centers. Defense IT convergence issues are as follows : the methods for introducing rapid changing IT to military area, rapid deployment procedures of verified commercial technologies and products, regulations for using of domestic software promotion and so on. We define the concept of defense IT convergence and propose the framework and processes for applying IT to our defense sector as one of industries. Also, we establish various business models in the military perspective using defense IT convergence framework. In this paper, we focus the development of defense IT convergence through the alignment of national IT convergence policy and propose various business models established through operating a defense IT convergence center."

This study investigated IT firms' concern about the defense acquisition process for IT-convergent systems and the role of IT firms in the process with Focus Group Interview and in-depth interview on executives of IT firms, and classified the concern to three major issues. They are the clarification of IT firms' role in the defense IT-convergent efforts, the establishment of the control tower for defense IT convergence, and reasonable estimation of software development cost in the defense acquisition process."
