This movement is considered a crucial factor in pioneering new markets, developing innovative technologies, and exploring new national growth engines for the country.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe strategic landscape of IT convergence in Korea is characterized by strong governmental support and its application across key sectors. The Korean government established a formal IT convergence policy in 2008, actively implementing it in core industries such as automotive, shipbuilding, and defense. This government-led effort aims to align national policy with industry development, addressing issues like the rapid introduction of commercial IT into specialized sectors and the promotion of domestic software.\n\nMajor industry examples of this trend include leading Korean corporations and key industrial sectors. The documents explicitly mention convergences involving major IT companies like **LG, Samsung, and POSCO**. Furthermore, the government's strategic focus highlights the **automotive, shipbuilding, and defense industries** as primary areas for implementing IT convergence initiatives.\n\n##Conclusion##\nIn summary, IT convergence in Korea is a strategic national initiative, driven by a government policy established in 2008. It aims to create new growth opportunities by integrating IT with core industries. This is exemplified by the activities of major corporations like LG, Samsung, and POSCO, and the targeted application of these principles within the automotive, shipbuilding, and defense sectors.",

This research analyzes various IT convergence issues based on an operation of defense IT convergence center, one of the industry IT convergence centers.

We define the concept of defense IT convergence and propose the framework and processes for applying IT to our defense sector as one of industries.
