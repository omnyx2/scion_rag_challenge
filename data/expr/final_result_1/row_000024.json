        "title": "Key Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models for Electricity Demand Prediction and Their Comparative Performance",
        "introduction": "For electricity demand prediction, several deep learning and machine learning models were evaluated, with their performance assessed using Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The primary goal was to identify effective methods for optimizing energy management systems by reducing energy wastage.",
        "main_body": "The models analyzed for electricity demand prediction include a machine learning method, error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP) structure, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) structure, and a proposed deep learning structure named CNN-LSTM. These methods were applied to electricity demand data collected in Germany for home appliances. The prediction accuracy of these models was reported in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The experimental results indicate that the CNN-LSTM model outperforms both eMLP and ARIMA in accuracy for electricity demand prediction. However, specific numerical values for the MSE and MAPE for each of these models (eMLP, ARIMA, and CNN-LSTM) are not provided within the given context.",
        "conclusion": "In summary, CNN-LSTM, eMLP, and ARIMA were evaluated for electricity demand prediction, with CNN-LSTM demonstrating superior accuracy compared to eMLP and ARIMA. While MSE and MAPE were the metrics used for evaluation, the precise numerical values for these metrics for each model are not detailed in the provided information."

                        "abstract": "In this study, a model was developed to predict the peak particle velocity (PPV) that affects people and the surrounding environment during blasting. Four machine learning models using the k-nearest neighbors (kNN), classification and regression tree (CART), support vector regression (SVR), and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-SVR algorithms were developed and compared with each other to predict the PPV. Mt. Yogmang located in Changwon-si, Gyeongsangnam-do was selected as a study area, and 1048 blasting data were acquired to train the machine learning models. The blasting data consisted of hole length, burden, spacing, maximum charge per delay, powder factor, number of holes, ratio of emulsion, monitoring distance and PPV. To evaluate the performance of the trained models, the mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE) were used. The PSO-SVR model showed superior performance with MAE, MSE and RMSE of 0.0348, 0.0021 and 0.0458, respectively. Finally, a method was proposed to predict the degree of influence on the surrounding environment using the developed machine learning models.",
