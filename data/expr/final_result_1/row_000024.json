Based on the provided context, a study was conducted to analyze and compare the effectiveness of different models for this purpose, using data collected from home appliances in Germany.\n\n##Main Body##\nThe study evaluated three key models, comprising both machine learning and deep learning approaches, to predict electricity demand. The performance of these models was measured using two standard accuracy metrics: Mean Square Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).\n\nThe models evaluated were:\n1.  **Error correction with multi-layer perceptron (eMLP):** A machine learning method.\n2.  **Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA):** A statistical analysis model commonly used for time-series forecasting.\n3.  **CNN-LSTM:** A proposed deep learning structure combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.\n\nIn a direct comparison of their performance, the experimental results indicated a clear hierarchy in accuracy. The proposed **CNN-LSTM** model demonstrated superior performance, outperforming both the eMLP and ARIMA models. While the context confirms that the prediction accuracy was reported in terms of MSE and MAPE, it does not provide the specific numerical values for these metrics for each model.\n\n##Conclusion##\nThe analysis for electricity demand prediction compared eMLP, ARIMA, and a proposed CNN-LSTM model. The study concluded that the deep learning-based CNN-LSTM structure is the most accurate of the three, achieving better results than the eMLP and ARIMA models when evaluated using MSE and MAPE metrics.",
