            "title": "Noninvasive Diabetes Detection Using CNN, LSTM, and SVM with HRV Signals",
            "introduction": "This research presents a methodology for the noninvasive detection of diabetes by classifying diabetic and normal Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals, which are derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Early detection of diabetes is crucial for timely treatment and preventing severe complications.",
            "main_body": "The methodology involves using deep learning architectures, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and their combinations. These networks are employed to extract complex temporal dynamic features from the input HRV data. Following feature extraction, these features are then passed into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the final classification of diabetes. The results indicate a performance improvement of 0.03% in the CNN architecture and 0.06% in the CNN-LSTM architecture when compared to previous work that did not utilize SVM. The proposed classification system demonstrates a very high accuracy of 95.7% in diagnosing diabetes using ECG signals.",
            "conclusion": "The combined approach of CNN, LSTM, and SVM for feature extraction and classification of HRV signals offers a highly accurate and effective method for noninvasive diabetes detection. This system can significantly aid clinicians in the early diagnosis of diabetes."
