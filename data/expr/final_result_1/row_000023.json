This approach uses Heart Rate Variability (HRV) signals, which are derived from the RR-intervals of an electrocardiogram (ECG), to classify individuals as diabetic or normal. Early detection is crucial for timely treatment and preventing serious complications associated with the disease.\n\n##Main Body##\n**Methodology:**\nThe core of the methodology involves a multi-stage process for analyzing HRV signals.\n1.  **Feature Extraction:** Deep learning models, specifically Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and combinations of the two (CNN-LSTM), are employed to extract complex temporal dynamic features from the input HRV data.\n2.  **Classification:** The features extracted by the deep learning models are then passed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the final classification, which determines whether the HRV signal belongs to a diabetic or a normal subject.\n\n**Results:**\nThe proposed classification system demonstrated significant success.\n*   The system achieved a very high accuracy of 95.7% in diagnosing diabetes from ECG signals.\n*   The inclusion of SVM for classification resulted in a notable performance improvement compared to earlier work that did not use it. Specifically, there was a 0.03% performance improvement in the CNN architecture and a 0.06% improvement in the CNN-LSTM architecture.\n\n##Conclusion##\nThe combination of CNN and LSTM for feature extraction, followed by an SVM for classification, proves to be a highly effective and accurate methodology for the non-invasive detection of diabetes using HRV signals. This system offers a promising tool for clinicians, enabling early diagnosis with an accuracy of 95.7%.",

Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM. The classification system proposed can help the clinicians to diagnose diabetes using ECG signals with a very high accuracy of 95.7%."
