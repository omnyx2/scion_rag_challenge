{"id": 1, "title": "The Importance of Artificial Intelligence to Economic Growth", "abstract": "The rapid development of artificial intelligence technology has exerted a great influence on all fields of the world, which of course also affects the world economy. This has also aroused a large number of economists' interest in this proposition. Since the definition of artificial intelligence is not unified yet, the results from previous researches are not reliable enough. At present, most scholars use the neoclassical growth model or task-based model to explore the path of artificial intelligence on economic variables. There into, most of them use the degree of automation to represent the artificial intelligence. They find that the degree of automation can change the proportion of industries. This only verifies that artificial intelligence can affect the economic variables. But the magnitude of artificial intelligence on economic variables can not be correctly estimated. Therefore, in order to have a better understanding on the impact of artificial intelligence on economic growth, this paper systematically reviews and collates previous literature on this topic. The results of this paper indicate that both in theoretical and empirical studies, artificial intelligence has a positive effect on economic growth. Then, some suggestions and limitations have also been put forward accordingly.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO201934651404424"}

The second sustainable development goal (SDG2) aims to address these challenges in every country to ensure not only that we eradicate global hunger, but also that everyone has access to safe and nutritious food that is produced in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable manner. SDG2 creates an unprecedented challenge to overcome the complexity of coordinating interventions that span the whole food chain (more accurately, `food network') and engage a bewildering breadth of individuals, stakeholders and agencies. The Sustainable Development Solutions Network recommends a generic enabling framework for SDG2 that connects the various stakeholders, and indicates the feedbacks and information flows that are needed to ensure effective execution. This platform is broadly relevant to all countries irrespective of their development status. A clear requirement for the success of this framework is the availability and free exchange of data, together with near real-time analytics on that data to create the necessary knowledge flows. The potential role of data-driven innovation in implementing the enabling framework in developing and western economies will be discussed using various case studies. The opportunities for deploying existing and new kinds of sensor and networking technologies will be explored.

This includes research in the field of genetics in areas ranging from medical research to anthropology. Developments in this area have inter alia been characterised by the ability to sequence genome wide sequences (GWS) cheaply, the ability to share and combine with other forms of complimentary data and ever more powerful processing techniques that have become possible given tremendous increases in computing power. Given that many if not most of these techniques will make use of personal data it is necessary to take into account data protection law. This article looks at challenges for researchers that will be presented by the EU's General Data Protection Regulation, which will be in effect from May 2018. The very nature of research with big data in general and genetic data in particular means that in many instances compliance will be onerous, whilst in others it may even be difficult to envisage how compliance may be possible. Compliance concerns include issues relating to &lsquo;purpose limitation&rsquo;, &lsquo;data minimisation&rsquo; and &lsquo;storage limitation&rsquo;. Other requirements, including the need to facilitate data subject rights and potentially conduct a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) may provide further complications for researchers. Further critical issues to consider include the choice of legal base: whether to opt for what is often seen as the &lsquo;default option&rsquo; (i.e. consent) or to process under the so called &lsquo;scientific research exception&rsquo;. Each presents its own challenges (including the likely need to gain ethical approval) and opportunities that will have to be considered according to the particular context in question.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART89948854"}

SBiFEM은 운전자 운행특성 및 도로의 다양한 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 운행 패턴과 공간 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 이용해 다양한 도로정보들을 입력변수로 추가 활용하는 분석 방법이다. 본 연구에서는 전처리, 공간빅데이터, 운행 패턴 생성에 이르는 전 과정에서 빅데이터 Map Reduce를 활용하는 공간빅데이터 분석 프로세스를 다음과 같이 수립하고 구현, 검증을 하였다. 첫째로, 전처리 기술 고도화이다. 센싱 데이터 및 GPS공간데이터 특성상 많은 양의 이상치 데이터(Outlier)가 존재하고 있어 이를 정제하지 않으면 분석결과도 신뢰할 수 없다. 이를 위해 통계기법 및 운행 패턴 분석을 이용한 필터링 기법을 연구하였다. 둘째로, 대량의 GPS궤적 데이터를 이용한 공간빅데이터 분석 체계이다. 차량 이동 데이터를 분석하기 위해서는 차량이 어느 도로에 위치 했는지를 알기 위한 전자지도와 매칭하는 맵매칭 기술이 필수적이다. 대부분의 맵매칭 기술은 실시간 내비게이션 용도로 주로 사용되어왔기 때문에 빠른 분석 속도를 요하는 빅데이터 분석에 적합하지 않다. 본 연구에서는 대량의 GPS궤적데이터를 전자지도에 매칭하는 빅데이터 맵매칭 기술을 연구하였다. 셋째로, 연료소모량을 추정하는 모델이다. 기존 추정 모델과의 차별점은 실제 운행환경을 반영하기 위한 변수들을 추가했다는 것이다. 한 종류는 차량 운행특성을 반영하는 운행 패턴이고, 또 한 종류는 전국의 다양한 도로 환경 정보이다. 이러한 도로 환경정보를 반영하기 위해 맵매칭 공간빅데이터 프로세스를 이용하였다. SBiFEM 빅데이터 분석시스템 테스트 및 검증은 5대의 분산 서버에 Hadoop, HBase와 Map Reduce프로그램을 수행하여 성능 검증을 하였다. 또한 연료소모량 추정 모델 검증은 대표적인 연료소모량 및 배출가스 추정 모델인 SIDRA, VSP, VT-Micro등을 DTG데이터를 적용하여 분석한 결과와 본 연구의 모델을 적용한 결과를 비교하여 검증하였다. 비교결과 추정 값과 실제 값을 비교한 Correlation이 0.9169, MAPE(평균절대백분비오차)가 0.1846으로 본 연구의 모델 적용시 가장 우수하게 나와 본 논문에서 개발한 모델의 우수성을 검증하였다.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=DIKO&cn=DIKO0013973515"}

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002574280"}

So we propose a methodology based on box-plot and data smoothing for controling outlier and noise in big data analysis. The proposed methodology is not dependent upon the normal assumption.

Also many algorithms based on loop detector data have been developed and tested for the Automatic Incident Detection(AID).

{"id": 40, "title": "Human- versus Artificial Intelligence", "abstract": "AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems little common understanding concerning the differences and similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence. Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness, explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more agreement and to substantiate possible future research objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1) the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial) intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and &ldquo;collaborate&rdquo; with) these systems as effectively as possible? For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI &ldquo;partners&rdquo; with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the underlying &lsquo;psychological&rsquo; mechanisms of AI. So, in order to obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness in humans should be addressed more vigorously.

Some universal measures of intelligence have been developed, but their dependence on goals and rewards creates serious problems. This paper sets out a new universal algorithm for measuring intelligence that is based on a system&rsquo;s ability to make accurate predictions. This algorithm can measure intelligence in humans, non-human animals and artificial systems. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that it can measure the changing intelligence of an agent in a maze environment. This new measure of intelligence could lead to a much better understanding of the relationship between intelligence and consciousness in natural and artificial systems, and it has many practical applications, particularly in AI safety.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART114737671"}

Recently, the big data market is growing rapidly around the world because data is processed on the basis of size, diversity, speed, accuracy and value. Specifically, this study focuses on its application to Jeju tourism. Research design, data, and methodology: The problems of big data were clearly presented using various real-world examples, and the verification of the compromise with small data and its effectiveness were conducted based on research papers discussing Jeju tourism using big data. The results of the study suggested the use of small data to solve and verify the representation of big data at the collection stage of the big data value chain, and the analysis stage suggested combining the identification of behavior patterns, the strengths of small data, and the exploration of causal relationships. Results: Among various stage, in the curation phase, a cause-and-effect analysis using small data suggested a solution to the problem of mistaking the correlation of big data as causality, and in the storage phase, a policy plan using small data was proposed to solve the problem of privacy infringement. The most important part of this study was the application stage, which discussed the specific problems of big data and the possibility of compromise between small data. As well, in the utilization phase, a combination of correlation and causality, as in the curation phase, was proposed. Conclusions: As an implication of this study, we used specific examples to present synergies when big data is compromised with small data. It also showed that the compromised use of big data and small data can contribute not only in terms of research but also in terms of practicality in tourism industry. Finally, we expanded the foundation of research in terms of academic research, discussing the trade-off utilization of big and small data.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002721909"}

Those case studies were initial investigations into the question of whether or not data quality issues encountered in Big Data collections are substantially different in cause, manifestation, or detection than those data quality issues encountered in more traditionally sized data collections. The study addresses several factors affecting Big Data Quality at multiple levels, including collection, processing, and storage. Though not unexpected, the key findings of this study reinforce that the primary factors affecting Big Data reside in the limitations and complexities involved with handling Big Data while maintaining its integrity. These concerns are of a higher magnitude than the provenance of the data, the processing, and the tools used to prepare, manipulate, and store the data. Data quality is extremely important for all data analytics problems. From the study's findings, the 'truth about Big Data' is there are no fundamentally new DQ issues in Big Data analytics projects.

The analysis of complex image analysis like histopathological define a crucial factor in oncology due to its ability to help pathologists for interpretation of images and therefore various feature extraction techniques have been evolved from time to time for such analysis. Although deep reinforcement learning is a new and emerging technique but very less effort has been made to compare the deep learning and deep reinforcement learning for image analysis. The paper highlights how both techniques differ in feature extraction from complex images and discusses the potential pros and cons. The use of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) in image segmentation, detection and diagnosis of tumour, feature extraction is important but there are several challenges that need to be overcome before Deep Learning can be applied to digital pathology. The one being is the availability of sufficient training examples for medical image datasets, feature extraction from whole area of the image, ground truth localized annotations, adversarial effects of input representations and extremely large size of the digital pathological slides (in gigabytes).Even though formulating Histopathological Image Analysis (HIA) as Multi Instance Learning (MIL) problem is a remarkable step where histopathological image is divided into high resolution patches to make predictions for the patch and then combining them for overall slide predictions but it suffers from loss of contextual and spatial information. In such cases the deep reinforcement learning techniques can be used to learn feature from the limited data without losing contextual and spatial information.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202009863559871"}

Results Through the phrase, we found that in order to construct the conscience of artificial intelligence, an algorithm must be constructed by considering the cognitive and emotional aspects. And in the process of constructing an artificial intelligence conscience algorithm, we confirmed that differentiated characteristics should be reflected depending on the situation and the object. Conclusion The value judgment of artificial intelligence is already being realized on universal standards. At the AGI level, in order to achieve value judgment, an algorithm that reflects conscience must be constructed to be close to human value judgment. For this, it is necessary to construct data and algorithms on the situation of value judgment and the relationship with the object.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003173924"}

{"id": 79, "title": "Enhancing Smart Grid Anomaly Detection Through Deep Learning", "abstract": "The modernization of power grids into smart grids introduces numerous benefits, including improved efficiency, reliability, and sustainability. But, the complicated and interconnected nature of smart grid systems also presents challenges, particularly in detecting anomalies and ensuring grid resilience against disruptive events. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of smart grid data, leading to inefficiencies in identifying and mitigating anomalies. To address these issues, this study proposes a new approach to enhance smart grid anomaly detection and resilience trough deep learning techniques, with a focus on leveraging the TensorFlow framework. The research objective is twofold: firstly, to develop advanced deep learning models capable of accurately detecting anomalies within smart grid data, and secondly, to enhance grid resilience by proactively responding to and mitigating identified anomalies. TensorFlow, a versatile deep learning framework, is chosen as the primary tool for its ability to handle large scale datasets, optimize model performance, and facilitate efficient training of complex neural network architectures. By using the power of deep learning, the developed models exhibit robustness in identifying subtle anomalies and devising proactive strategies to mitigate their impact.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART003160214"}

The incidence of hypertension is increasing not only in Korea but also in many Western countries due to the aging of the population and the increase in unhealthy lifestyles. However, hypertension control rates remain low due to poor adherence to antihypertensive medications, low awareness of hypertension, and numerous factors that contribute to hypertension, including diet, environment, lifestyle, obesity, and genetics. Because artificial intelligence (AI) involves data-driven algorithms, AI is an asset to understanding chronic diseases that are influenced by multiple factors, such as hypertension. Although several hypertension studies using AI have been published recently, most are exploratory descriptive studies that are often difficult for clinicians to understand and have little clinical relevance. This review aims to provide a clinician-centered perspective on AI by showing recent studies on the relevance of AI for patients with hypertension. The review is organized into sections on blood pressure measurement and hypertension diagnosis, prognosis, and management.

We argue that deep learning can play a central role in advancing the state-of-the-art in a wide range of radar imaging problems, discuss the challenges associated with applying these methods, and the potential advancements that are expected. We lay out an approach to design a network architecture based on the specific structure of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging problem that augments learning with traditional SAR modelling.

{"id": 86, "title": "Big data monetization throughout Big Data Value Chain: a comprehensive review", "abstract": "AbstractValue Chain has been considered as a key model for managing efficiently value creation processes within organizations. However, with the digitization of the end-to-end processes which began to adopt data as a main source of value, traditional value chain models have become outdated. For this, researchers have developed new value chain models, called Data Value Chains, to carry out data driven organizations. Thereafter, new data value chains called Big Data Value chain have emerged with the emergence of Big Data in order to face new data-related challenges such as high volume, velocity, and variety. These Big Data Value Chains describe the data flow within organizations which rely on Big Data to extract valuable insights. It is a set of ordered steps using Big Data Analytics tools and mainly built for going from data generation to knowledge creation. The advances in Big Data and Big Data Value Chain, using clear processes for aggregation and exploitation of data, have given rise to what is called data monetization. Data monetization concept consists of using data from an organization to generate profit. It may be selling the data directly for cash, or relying on that data to create value indirectly. It is important to mention that the concept of monetizing data is not as new as it looks, but with the era of Big Data and Big Data Value Chain it is becoming attractive. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of value creation, data value, and Big Data value chains with their different steps. This literature has led us to construct an end-to-end exhaustive BDVC that regroup most of the addressed phases. Furthermore, we present a possible evolution of that generic BDVC to support Big Data Monetization. For this, we discuss different approaches that enable data monetization throughout data value chains. Finally, we highlight the need to adopt specific data monetization models to suit big data specificities.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101331280"}

Learning is challenging due to the scale of the model and noisy data: there are hundreds of thousands of workers with high-variance abilities. This paper presents an end-to-end system that first learns TurKontrol's POMDP parameters from real Mechanical Turk data, and then applies the model to dynamically optimize live tasks. We validate the model and use it to control a successive-improvement process on Mechanical Turk. By modeling worker accuracy and voting patterns, our system produces significantly superior artifacts compared to those generated through nonadaptive workflows using the same amount of money.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART120023140"}

Big Data governance refers to the management of huge volumes of an organization&rsquo;s data, exploiting it in the organization&rsquo;s decision-making using different analytical tools. Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks. Therefore, this study aims to explore the existing Big Data governance frameworks and their shortcomings, and propose a new framework. The proposed framework consists of eight components. As a framework validation, the proposed framework has been compared with the ISO 8000 data governance framework.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART91115436"}

A machine learning political order does not merely change the political technologies of governance, but is itself a reordering of politics, of what the political can be. When algorithmic systems reduce the pluridimensionality of politics to the output of a model, they simultaneously foreclose the potential for other political claims to be made and alternative political projects to be built. More than this foreclosure, a machine learning political order actively profits and learns from the fracturing of communities and the destabilising of democratic rights. The transformation from rules-based algorithms to deep learning models has paralleled the undoing of rules-based social and international orders - from the use of machine learning in the campaigns of the UK EU referendum, to the trialling of algorithmic immigration and welfare systems, and the use of deep learning in the COVID-19 pandemic - with political problems becoming reconfigured as machine learning problems. Machine learning political orders decouple their attributes, features and clusters from underlying social values, no longer tethered to notions of good governance or a good society, but searching instead for the optimal function of abstract representations of data.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART122432758"}

The gold standard for fibrosis assessment, liver biopsy, has recently been replaced by noninvasive scores. In this study, we validated liver fibrosis-associated biomarkers using machine learning techniques applied in medical research and evaluated their prediction models.Methods: Noninvasive scores were assayed in 144 patients who underwent transient elastography (TE). The patients were divided into three groups (<7 kPa, 7–10 kPa, ≥10 kPa) according to their TE results. Feature selection and modeling for predicting liver fibrosis were performed using random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM).Results: Considering the mean decrease in impurity, permutation importance, and multicollinear analysis, the important features for differentiating between the three groups were Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi), platelet count, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Using these features, the RF and SVM models showed equivalent or better performance than noninvasive scores. The sensitivities of RF and SVM models for predicting ≥7 kPa TE results were higher than noninvasive scores (83.3% and 90.0% vs. <80%, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of RF and SVM models for ≥10 kPa TE result was 100%.Conclusions: We used machine learning techniques to verify the usefulness of established serological biomarkers (M2BPGi, PLT, and AST) that predict liver fibrosis.

Its incidence rates are increasing alarmingly every year. If untreated, diabetes-related complications in many vital organs of the body may turn fatal. Early detection of diabetes is very important for timely treatment which can stop the disease progressing to such complications. RR-interval signals known as heart rate variability (HRV) signals (derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals) can be effectively used for the non-invasive detection of diabetes. This research paper presents a methodology for classification of diabetic and normal HRV signals using deep learning architectures. We employ long short-term memory (LSTM), convolutional neural network (CNN) and its combinations for extracting complex temporal dynamic features of the input HRV data. These features are passed into support vector machine (SVM) for classification. We have obtained the performance improvement of 0.03% and 0.06% in CNN and CNN-LSTM architecture respectively compared to our earlier work without using SVM.

With the internet-based platform, customers can order goods easily using their smart phones and get delivery at their place without going to the shopping mall. However, the drawback of this business platform is that customers do not really know about the quality of the products they ordered. Therefore, such platform service often provides the review section to let previous customers leave a review about the received product. The reviews are a good source to analyze customer's satisfaction. Business owners can assess review trend as either positive or negative based on a feedback score that customers had given, but it takes too much time for human to analyze this data. In this research, we develop computational models using machine learning techniques to classify product reviews as positive or negative based on the sentiment analysis. In our experiments, we use the book review data from amazon.com to develop the models. For a machine learning based strategy, the data had been transformed with the bag of word technique before developing models using logistic regression, na&iuml;ve bayes, support vector machine, and neural network algorithms. For a deep learning strategy, the word embedding is a technique that we used to transform data before applying the long short-term memory and gated recurrent unit techniques.

{"id": 171, "title": "Protecting Privacy in Big Data", "abstract": "In an age of big data, privacy is more essential than ever before, but if we are to protect it effectively, while continuing to enjoy the benefits that big data is already making possible, we need to evolve better, faster, and more scalable mechanisms.The following are the four core elements critical to effective governance of big data.First, a transformation of the current approach to a risk management approach that places more responsibility for data stewardship, and liability for reasonably foreseeable harms, on the users of data rather than using notice and consent to shift the burden to individuals seems critical. This is because a continuing broad reliance on notice and choice at time of collection both under-protects privacy and seriously interferes with—and raises the cost of— subsequent beneficial uses of data.Second, data protection should focus more on uses of big data as opposed to the mere collection or retention of data or the purposes for which data were originally collected. One key reason why a more use-focused approach is necessary to capture the value of big data is that the analysis of big data doesn’t always start with a question or hypothesis, but rather may reveal insights that were never anticipated. As a result, data protection based on a notice specifying intended uses of data and consent for collection based on that notice can result in blocking socially valuable uses of data, lead to meaninglessly broad notices, or require exceptions to the terms under which the individual consented. If privacy protection is instead based on a risk analysis of a proposed use, then it is possible to achieve an optimum benefit from the use of the data and optimum protection for data fine-tuned for each intended use.Third, a risk management approach guided by a broad framework of cognizable harms identified through a transparent, inclusive process is critical to ensuring that individuals are protected and enhancing predictability, accountability, and efficiency.Fourth, a risk management approach that provides meaningful transparency and redress, together with effective enforcement, not only provide remedies for current harms, but also help to prevent future ones.Moreover, it is an essential requirement for responsible use of big data.There are likely many other measures that also will be useful, but these four are critical to protecting privacy while unlocking the potential of big data.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART001996011"}

{"id": 173, "title": "&#x201e;Massendinghaltung“ oder &#x201e;Big Data“?", "abstract": "SummaryThe tenor of the conference &#x201e;Massendinghaltung in der Arch&auml;ologie&ldquo; held in Berlin from 23rd to 25th May 2013 shows that many archaeologists, especially those with a theoretical orientation, are very negative towards large collections of objects and their evaluation. This was taken as an opportunity to present five examples from the Roman Period, based on the author&rsquo;s own data collection, which cannot be meaningfully processed without large collections of material. First of all, there are copper-plated iron objects, in which two already known belt boxes are joined by an Almgren group VII-fibula and a small bucket-shaped necklace pendant. They show that copper plating was also possible in germanic fine forges. A discovery of petrified sea urchins (echinites) shows that such quite rare find objects have not been worked on so far, as they seem to be of little value and the research effort for these objects might be considered too high. As a third example, vessels with button-handels (Knopfhenkelgef&auml;ße) were selectet. A type of vessel that has already been worked on. With the help of a database-supported recording of meanwhile more than 28,500 grave inventories as well as further literature research, the existing find image can be checked, supplemented and, if necessary, extended. As a fourth example the frequently occurring amber finds are presented. Apart from Tempelmann-M&aogon;czy&nacute;skas&rsquo;s work on pearls, no attempt has yet been made to deal with this object category on a supra-regional level. Due to their work, one had a rather tolerable impression of the occurrence of this find category, especially concerning Germany. The repeatedly expressed opinion that amber could not be found in cremations, because it would have been burnt, is a topos. A clear focus in the Elbe-Saale area shows a region that either appears early as a customer or even as a middleman for the period from the 3rd century onwards. Finally, thanks to a large number of settlement and especially cemetery publications, statistical analyses of population sizes and demographic changes are now possible, as can be illustrated by the two examples of eastern Holstein and the Altmark.De nombreuses publications de recueils de donn&eacute;es sont d&eacute;sormais omnipr&eacute;sentes dans l&rsquo;arch&eacute;ologie.

This paper presents an IT-convergence solution that fuses disruptive technologies to distinguish between vaccinated and non-vaccinated individuals in real-time and initiate strict and appropriate compliance directives and consequent denial of access to certain places. The proposed design is a fusion of facial recognition, mask wearing detection technology using Yolov5 deep learning model, network-based vaccination record management application, biometric feature-based vaccination status validation, and compliance enforcement in real-time. The system achieved 99.5&#x0025; accurate detection and 100&#x0025; real-time authentication with less computational complexities. This innovation guarantees intuitive monitoring of vaccination progress and curtailment of COVID-19 spread through compliance enforcement.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NPAP&cn=NPAP13570757"}
{"id": 195, "title": "Deep Contour Recovery: Repairing Breaks in Detected Contours using Deep Learning", "abstract": "We present a contour recovery framework based on a deep learning model to connect broken contours (breaks) produced by contour detection methods. The idea is that the convolutional neural network iteratively predicts vectors that can grow along the direction of the true contour from the end points of the breaks. For this prediction, we use residual connections training, which models continuous predictions from the previous inference. However, conventional residual connections training is prone to gradually accumulating errors at each inference step. In this work, we propose a ground truth selection algorithm and sub-iteration training to efficiently and reliably train a deep learning model. The ground truth selection extracts a small set of coordinates to represent an actual contour. The sub-iteration training creates the next input that is predicted by additional training of a network replicated from the main network. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ground truth selection creates a ground truth suitable for contour recovery. Moreover, our approach improves the performance of contour detection when applied to the results of existing representative contour detection methods.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002638568"}

Big data arises secondary to scholarly inquiry (e.g., &#8208;omics) and everyday observations like cardiac flow sensors or Twitter feeds. Data science methods that are emerging ensure that these data be leveraged to improve patient care.Organizing ConstructBig data encompasses data that exceed human comprehension, that exist at a volume unmanageable by standard computer systems, that arrive at a velocity not under the control of the investigator and possess a level of imprecision not found in traditional inquiry. Data science methods are emerging to manage and gain insights from big data.MethodsThe primary methods included investigation of emerging federal big data initiatives, and exploration of exemplars from nursing informatics research to benchmark where nursing is already poised to participate in the big data revolution. We provide observations and reflections on experiences in the emerging big data initiatives.ConclusionsExisting approaches to large data set analysis provide a necessary but not sufficient foundation for nursing to participate in the big data revolution. Nursing's Social Policy Statement guides a principled, ethical perspective on big data and data science. There are implications for basic and advanced practice clinical nurses in practice, for the nurse scientist who collaborates with data scientists, and for the nurse data scientist.Clinical RelevanceBig data and data science has the potential to provide greater richness in understanding patient phenomena and in tailoring interventional strategies that are personalized to the patient.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART76701778"}

Deep learning image classification was used to classify the cuts of beef, and OpenCV technology was used to determine the freshness and marbling of the beef. The application was developed in a client-server system for real-time action. The mobile phone of the user (the client) will take a photo of the beef and send it to the server, and the server will analyze the received image to identify and determine the cuts of beef, freshness, and marbling of the beef. The results will then be sent back to the client from the server. Artificial Intelligence technology is used to develop applications with these functions. Image classification technology is used for the classification function of beef parts, and OpenCV's clustering technology is used to determine the freshness and marbling grade of beef.

In this article, the implications for data management in companies are worked out on the basis of the view of the nature of the data, the various roles in machine learning teams and the life cycle of machine learning models.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART101894389"}
{"id": 222, "title": "Big Data Misuse and European Contract Law", "abstract": "AbstractThe dynamics of contractual interactions have been evolving in recent years, as big data introduces new dimensions to previously conventional contracts. This development intensifies the information asymmetry between the dominant and vulnerable parties, posing increasing challenges for consumers and the entirety of European contract law. This paper offers three main contributions to this discourse. First, the utilization of big data introduces a novel form of information asymmetry between contracting parties, further empowering the already dominant party while exacerbating the vulnerability of the weaker party. Second, contemporary European case law and legal scholarship advocate for a harmonious approach in which European regulations and national remedies complement one another in protecting individuals. Lastly, there are already instances indicating the misuse of big data, where multiple individual claims may arise at both European and national levels.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=NART132663034"}
{"id": 223, "title": "학습전략과 심층학습", "abstract": "Learning strategies are defined as behaviors and thoughts that a learner engages in during learning and that are intended to influence the learner's encoding process. Today, demands for teaching how to learn increase, because there is a lot of complex material which is delivered to students. But learning strategies shouldn't be identified as tricks of students for achieving high scores in exams. Cognitive researchers and theorists assume that learning strategies are related to two types of learning processing, which are described as 'surface learning' and 'deep learning'. In addition learning strategies are associated with learning motivation. Students with 'meaning orientation' who struggle for deep learning, are intrinsically motivated, whereas students with 'reproduction orientation' or 'achieving orientation' are extrinsically motivated. Therefore, to foster active learning and intrinsic motivation of students, it isn't enough to just teach how to learn. Changes of curriculum and assessment methods, that stimulate deep learning and curiosity of students are needed with educators and learners working cooperatively.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO200923354858103"}
{"id": 224, "title": "Trends of Artificial Intelligence Product Certification Programs", "abstract": "With recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, more products based on AI are being launched and used. However, using AI safely requires an awareness of the potential risks it can pose. These concerns must be evaluated by experts and users must be informed of the results. In response to this need, many countries have implemented certification programs for products based on AI. In this study, we analyze several trends and differences in AI product certification programs across several countries and emphasize the importance of such programs in ensuring the safety and trustworthiness of products that include AI. To this end, we examine four international AI product certification programs and suggest methods for improving and promoting these programs. The certification programs target AI products produced for specific purposes such as autonomous intelligence systems and facial recognition technology, or extend a conventional software quality certification based on the ISO/IEC 25000 standard. The results of our analysis show that companies aim to strategically differentiate their products in the market by ensuring the quality and trustworthiness of AI technologies. Additionally, we propose methods to improve and promote the certification programs based on the results. These findings provide new knowledge and insights that contribute to the development of AI-based product certification programs.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=JAKO202326943334293"}
{"id": 225, "title": "Speech Recognition using Machine Learning", "abstract": "Speech recognition is one of the fastest-growing engineering technologies. It has several applications in different areas, and provides many potential benefits. A lot of people are unable to communicate due to language barriers. We aim to reduce this barrier via our project, which was designed and developed to achieve systems in particular cases to provide significant help so people can share information by operating a computer using voice input. This project keeps that factor in mind, and an effort is made to ensure our project is able to recognize speech and convert input audio into text; it also enables a user to perform file operations like Save, Open, or Exit from voice-only input. We design a system that can recognize the human voice as well as audio clips, and translate between English and Hindi. The output is in text form, and we provide options to convert audio from one language to the other. Going forward, we expect to add functionality that provides dictionary meanings for Hindi and English words. Neural machine translation is the primary algorithm used in the industry to perform machine translation. Two recurrent neural networks used in tandem to construct an encoder–decoder structure are the architecture behind neural machine translation. This work on speech recognition starts with an introduction to the technology and the applications used in different sectors. Part of the report is based on software developments in speech recognition.", "source": "http://click.ndsl.kr/servlet/OpenAPIDetailView?keyValue=05787966&target=NART&cn=ART002724517"}
